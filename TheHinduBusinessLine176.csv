IPL 2019 was watched by a whopping 462 million viewers^ according to BARC data^ with official broadcaster Star Sports improving its reach by 12 per cent compared to 2018.This year^ Star^ which is beaming the tournament live in multiple languages and over 20 channels^ hopes to improve on that performance.On the revenue front^ too^ Star is on a song^ with five co-presenting sponsors including Dream11^ PhonePe^ Amazon^ Vodafone Idea and Byju's^ and 13 associate sponsors lined up.Higher ad ratesAccording to Star Sports^ nearly 95 per cent of the inventory has been sold. Media planning sources say the ad rates are fairly pricey at ₹12-12.5 lakh per 10 seconds. Over 60 advertisers are already on board and last-minute buys at higher premiums are being negotiated. E-commerce^ telecom^ FMCG^ fantasy sports^ edutech^ BFSI and auto are the key spenders on the T20 tournament.Star is also increasing the programming content around the IPL^ by packing in analysis and other shows.Meanwhile^ Disney Hotstar is upping the fan engagement with new features to its ‘Watch n Play’ feed. The live feed on the OTT platform will only be accessible to those who take an annual subscription package.Teams on edgeWhile Star sees a glittering IPL^ for franchisees things are a bit more challenging. The sponsorship payout to them from the BCCI will be lower as the rates have come down and there will be no gate collections. In previous IPLs^ teams like Mumbai Indians and CSK earned as much as ₹20 crore on ticket sales.However^ some teams — especially KKR^ CSK and MI — are on a strong wicket. According to sources^ KKR has sold all its sponsorship positions at high rates. Mumbai Indians and CSK^ too^ have signed pacts with a bevy of sponsors and official partners.This year^ most teams are paying more attention to merchandise sales and have entered into new associations for these. Many feel that the IPL could be a sentiment booster. Coinciding with the festival season^ a period that contributes nearly 40-45 per cent to annual ad spends by brands^ the advertising fraternity is hoping it will change the cycle.As Ashish Bhasin^ CEO^ APAC and Chairman^ India - Dentsu Aegis Network^ says: “IPL has the potential to kickstart the virtuous cycle where improvement in consumer sentiment could lead to an uptick in demand^ which can in turn improve ad spends.”(with inputs from G Balachandar in Chennai and Abhishek Law in Kolkata),18,09

Discretionary items are also on a “recovery track”^ he said.“Our Health & Hygiene portfolio comprising a range of products under Zandu ^ BoroPlus & Menthoplus contributed 43 per ent to the domestic sales and grew by 29 per cent during the quarter.

Demand for hygiene and immunity-boosting products are growing^ while online purchase is experiencing at an all-time high.“As the lockdowns and social distancing norms impacted the traditional channels of distribution^ especially in April and May^ the e-commerce channel doubled its revenues during the quarter in domestic business^” Agarwal added.Emami has also introduced the hygiene range for its international business^ which was well-received^ he further said.,18,09

""This year’s ranking was worth $216 billion in brand value^ a decline of 6 per cent over last year^ driven largely by a slowdown in the banking and automotive sector. Despite this^ 26 brands increased in value^ and five were new entrants. India’s top brands also performed well against other countries where declines in brand value were much greater^ "" the rankings report stated.Retail^ telecom and personal care brands were among the fastest-growing categories. While retail brands witnessed a growth of 33 per cent^ personal care grew by 32 per cent^ and telecom segment was up 25 per cent in terms of increase in brand values.At a time when the retail sector displayed agility to cater to the evolving needs of consumers amid the pandemic^ Reliance Retail witnessed a 102 per cent growth in brand value moving up 30 places to number 25 in the brand rankings. "" The brand’s core grocery offerings^ as well as its integrations with other Reliance Group partners^ have become agile assets for its parent company during the Covid-19 lockdown^"" the rankings study stated.Preeti Reddy^ the CEO - South Asia^ Insights Division^ Kantar^ said: ""The performance of retail^ telecom and FMCG brands has shown that being agile in times of crisis is critical for growth.

Meanwhile^ Dove^ Indraprastha Gas^ Close Up^ and Crompton were among the brands that featured for the first time this year in the rankings.Reddy pointed out that with shrinking wallets due to the pandemic induced economic downturn^ brand salience and market differentiation have become among the key factors for brands to navigate the current challenges.

2020-09-13,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/marico-plans-to-inject-a-booster-dose-to-foods-biz/article32593755.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Marico plans to inject a booster dose to foods biz,Saugata Gupta expects to be working out of home from his Mumbai apartment till the end of September. It’s been like that since the pandemic started for the Managing Director and CEO of Marico Ltd. But now^ work days on video and phone calls are long^ stretching from 8.30 am to well past 9 pm as he strategises the launch of a clutch of new products^ oversees marketing plans^ and drives sales to new highs even as he worries over distribution.With Covid-19 still raging^ Gupta says consumption habits have now been reset into three broad categories: health and hygiene; the immunity plank for foods and^ third^ ready-to-cook foods or between-meal snacks. “Once things settle down^ demand may come down in many categories though that level may be higher than what it was pre-Covid. But I see a permanent reset on these three planks^” he says.The most ambitious plan that Marico has is in foods. Extending the Saffola franchise^ it recently launched honey^ which it claims is one of the purest in the maket. “There will be some more launches in the immunity space and in foods^ as also in the in-between meals category in the next couple of months. We have an ambitious plan for foods. We finished 2019–20 at Rs 200 crore in foods and we want to take it up to at least Rs 300 crore-plus by 2020-21. And^ the attempt is to hit the Rs 500-crore mark in the next two years^” says Gupta. Marico’s total revenues in FY 19-20 were Rs 6^161 crore.Of the three planks that Gupta outlines^ Marico does not yet have critical mass in health and hygiene and has now made its foray into the immunity space with honey. “Fortunately^ 80 to 90 per cent of our portfolio consists of items of daily consumption where we can grab market share. And there is also a huge opportunity to quickly get scale in others so that they become a significant part of our portfolio^” says Gupta of the immunity-giving foods the company plans to launch.Launches aplentyThe past few months have seen a flurry of launches from Marico^ in response to the pandemic effects. Mediker hand sanitiser and Veggie Clean are a couple of the new products in the market. Veggie Clean^ claimed to be an industry-first^ is a soap/chlorine/alcohol-free product that can be used to clean all kinds of vegetables and fruits and can remove any viruses on the produce.Marico also launched KeepSafe^ a range of premium out-of-home hygiene products that includes toilet seat disinfectant^ multi-purpose disinfectant spray^ hand sanitiser^ hygiene hand wipes^ feminine hygiene wipes and soon to be launched intimate wash as well. Along with this^ it also launched Marico’s Travel Protect and House Protect^ effective against viruses^ bacteria and fungi on multiple surfaces^ without the need to wipe them down after spraying.Gupta is emphatic that new products need to have a differentiated proposition^ For example^ Marico hasn’t entered the hand-wash segment in the domestic market. “There are so many existing brands there’s no point making a tactical entry. We need to have a more sustainable position^ so we are looking for differentiated spaces. It’s easy to get short-term volumes^ but I would rather spend my energies in getting into something where I have a long-term right to it^” explains Gupta. With at least 250 brands of sanitisers in the market now^ he says its current entry is merely a tactical move.Consumers^ he says^ are looking for trusted brands^ and top brands are likely to win^ “Consumers’ disposable incomes are down^ so leader brands should ensure there is downtrading within the brand itself rather than outside. If you are providing the right value at lower price points^ such as value packs at entry level^ there will be downtrading within the brand^” he explains.Distribution channelsApart from new products^ Gupta has also been deliberating with his team on distribution channels. Clearly^ during the pandemic^ it was proved that availability of a product on shelves equalled market share. “When the lockdown started we looked at several models to ensure reach to the distributor and end consumer.”It looked at third-party logistics to deliver to consumers as some distributors didn’t have the manpower to load and unload products. Or^ take orders without physically visiting stores; it started telecalling them. For the last mile to consumer^ it also experimented by using food delivery aggregators such as Swiggy^ Zomato as well as Dunzo. “Some are scalable^ some not^ we are dropping some of the prototypes and will be ready to scale up some of the other initiatives and we believe that what we will have is a differentiated new age supply chain and go-to-market strategy. Something that would have taken three to four years but because of Covid will be accelerated to a one-year time frame^” elaborates Gupta.Also^ he says^ the distributor role could change. It was the distributor who was doing everything^ from demand generation and market credit to stock delivering. But in metros the role of distributors could change to demand generation only and maybe market credit^ but fulfilment could be done by someone else. In the future^ a distributor in Mumbai and Delhi could be holding one day of stock cover^ says Gupta. “For companies that have direct distribution it will be a source of competitive advantage as share of wholesale channel goes down^” he adds.Consumer product companies need to up the ante in digital transformation^ says Gupta. Marico has been investing ahead of the curve in digital; pre-Covid^ e-comm was 5 per cent of sales. Marico recently launched a direct to consumer portal^ (stores.saffola.in) which makes it easier to place orders directly for products such as Saffola edible oil^ oats and masala oats and the Saffola Fittify gourmet range as well as its Mediker range. “We are on a journey of digital transformation; Covid has forced this pace; what could have happened in three years is now compressed to one year. Marketing^ e.comm^ analytics^ automation... everything has got to change. We expect e-commerce to contribute 8 per cent of sales this fiscal^” says Gupta. For the likes of Gupta^ who graduated from B-school in the early 1990s^ digital and social media have been a steep and quick learning.,13,09
2020-09-11,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/contraction-of-factory-output-narrows-in-july-ep/article32583410.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,At -10.4% in July^ IIP contraction slows,Factory output contracted at slower pace in July 2020 at 10.4 per cent^ reflecting the output improvement from the unlocking of the economy from June.However^ the latest print was much worse than the 4.9 per cent IIP growth recorded in July 2019.The July 2020 Index of Industrial Production (IIP) contraction was slower than the contraction of revised 15.8 per cent in June 2020^ 33.8 per cent in May and record 57.6 per cent in April 2020.The latest IIP print is also in line with core sector output which showed signs of recovering as its contraction too slowed in July 2020 at 9.6 per cent^ compared to (-) 12.9 per cent in June 2020. The eight core sector industries together account for 40 per cent weightage of IIP.For July 2020^ manufacturing output contracted 11.1 per cent while mining contracted 13 per cent and electricity generation contracted 2.5 per cent^ official data released on Friday showed.On the use-based classification^ consumer non-durables was the only category posting a growth^ although the pace of its expansion halved in July 2020.Aditi Nayar^ Principal Economist^ ICRA^ said that the contraction of 10.4 per cent posted by the IIP in July 2020 trailed ICRA’s expectation of a 9.0 per cent de-growth on account of a modestly weaker than anticipated performance of all the three sectors — mining^ manufacturing and electricity.“Based on the sharp^ albeit base effect-led turnaround in the performance of the output of Coal India Limited^ the further narrowing de-growth in generation of GST e-way bills^ as well as the mild worsening in the contraction in electricity generation in August 2020^ we are hopeful that the pace of contraction of the IIP could ease to 6-8 per cent in August 2020^” she said.Madan Sabnavis^ Chief Economist^ CARE Ratings^ said that the IIP print for July was on expected lines. One can expect the August IIP to be in negative zone too before some turnaround in September^ he added.FMCG positive“IIP performance showed progress in July 2020 month-on-month. Only FMCG was positive^ driven by pharma mainly. The lockdown impact in July was less severe. One can expect numbers to be better next month though negative^” Sabnavis said.Sunil Kumar Sinha^ Principal Economist^ India Ratings^ said that the July 2020 IIP data^ as expected^ shows further recovery in the factory output. Though in terms of year-on-year growth factory output growth is still negative 10.4 per cent^ the negative growth is consistently declining since April 2020.“This kind of trend has been observed in many other high frequency data as well. However^ the data also shows that the sharp recovery witnessed in the month of May and June is now becoming somewhat flattish. Part of the reason is local/partial/weekend lockdown imposed in many parts of the country^ often without much advance intimation. This is not allowing orderly recovery of economic activities^” he said.,11,09

The study said restructuring will also be available to a large number of companies that opted for the moratorium. Every second company in Crisil’s portfolio that did so will qualify for restructuring.Three out of four entities in the portfolio that availed of moratorium are rated in the sub-investment grade (rated ‘BB+’ or lower).Resilient vs less resilientWhile the parameters support debt restructuring across rating categories^ Crisil’s study indicated that companies in the resilient sectors stand to benefit more.Sectoral resilience is the ability of a sector to sustain the revenue impact of Covid-19 and bounce back to full production after the pandemic peters out.The agency assessed that three out of four rated ones in the resilient sectors such as construction^ chemicals^ pharmaceuticals^ iron and steel manufacturing^ corporate retail^ and consumer durables/FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) will qualify for restructuring.In the less-resilient sectors such as auto dealerships^ gems and jewellery^ hotels^ restaurants and tourism^ power generation^ and real estate^ the study said opportunities for debt restructuring could be a little lower as these sectors can take longer to recover. Here^ only one in three companies could be eligible for restructuring.Rahul Guha^ Director^ Crisil Ratings^ said: “The situation is still evolving and the actual number of eligible companies could increase in case of favourable developments such as faster-than-expected turnaround of the economy^ banks choosing to convert interest charges to funded interest term loan or exploring other innovative ways of restructuring or promoters bringing in capital. A final picture on how many companies have qualified for restructuring will emerge only over the next 3-4 months.”,10,09

Such an approach may also entail classification of the impact on the borrowers into mild^ moderate or severe^ as recommended by the Committee.India Ratings has estimated that around 7.7 per cent (₹8.4-lakh crore) of the total bank credit as at end-March 2020 from corporate and non-corporate segments could get restructured under the Covid resolution framework.,07,09

The company’s international business grew by 4.9 per cent during FY2019-20.Stating that the “demand dynamics have undergone a sea change” since the Covid-19 outbreak^ as consumers are increasingly seeking products to boost immunity and personal and household hygiene needs^ Burman said that the company’s management displayed “nimble-footedness and agility” to respond to the changing dynamics and meet the emerging needs of the consumers.The FMCG major has launched over 50 new products and variants within weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak. “The fact that a majority of which were launched during and after the lockdown period reflecting a strong and committed effort to mitigate the immediate crisis and emerge from it stronger and future ready^” he added.It had also forayed into the personal and household hygiene segments with brand Dabur Sanitize.“The pandemic has also led to a shift in shopping behaviour of consumers with the propensity for online shopping increasing. Targeting this emerging trend^ we have started launching a series of new products exclusively for online markets^” Burman said. The company recently launched products such as Dabur Apple Cider Vinegar and the Dabur Baby Care range exclusively online.“The challenges of Covid are far from over and the road ahead is full of challenges^ but it is equally exciting and promising.

The company’s snacks — Lay’s^ Kurkure and Uncle Chipps — will be listed on CSC’s e-commerce platform that has been set up to promote digital ordering and doorstep delivery in rural areas. In the initial phase^ PepsiCo India is starting a pilot in Sultanpur District of Uttar Pradesh and its products will be listed on the Grameen e-store through 264 Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs).This partnership comes at a time when the FMCG industry is banking on faster recovery in demand in rural regions in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the growth in rural demand expected to outpace urban demand^ FMCG companies are focusing on ramping up their direct and indirect distribution in rural regions.In July^ Coca-Cola India had also announced a similar partnership with CSCs and said that its products will be listed on the Grameen e-Store platform across Andhra Pradesh^ Telengana^ Tamil Nadu^ Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.CSCs come under the aegis of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the CSC Grameen e-Store can only be set up by CSC VLEs. This e-commere initiative was kick-started in April and so far over nine lakh orders worth ₹70 crore have been serviced through the CSC’s rural e-commerce initiative.Aditya Sinha^ Senior Director and Head-Sales^ PepsiCo India said said that the company has been focusing on strengthening the last mile connectivity in rural communities. “One of the biggest challenges posed by the pandemic^ was the reverse migration of the working class from cities to rural areas. Given this reality^ making our products available via innovative service channels across the rural landscape clearly emerged as a key priority area for PepsiCo India^” he said.“Our partnership with the CSC Grameen e-Store will further boost our efforts to delivery consumers’ favourite snacks at their doorstep in the rural regions^” Sinha added.,01,09
2020-08-31,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/three-of-four-companies-that-availed-moratorium-rated-in-sub-investment-grade-crisil/article32485123.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Three of four companies that availed moratorium rated in sub-investment grade: Crisil,Three out of four entities that availed of moratorium are rated in the sub-investment grade^ according to credit rating agency Crisil. Most of them were grappling with a slowing economy before the pandemic began^ it addedThe severely curtailed business activity that followed in the first quarter of this fiscal had cramped cash flows^ so the moratorium came as a big relief^ the agency said.Only one out of four companies that availed of the moratorium is rated in the investment grade (rated Crisil BBB- or higher). The agency observed that they took recourse to the moratorium to build a liquidity cushion for exigencies in the near term.Crisil noted that the moratorium on loan repayments provided by banks at the behest of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has provided much-needed liquidity support to mid-sized sub-investment grade (rated Crisil BB+ or lower) companies.“It has also prevented a sharp weakening of their credit profiles. While the moratorium ended today^ the debt restructuring announced by the RBI recently can play a crucial role in supporting the credit profiles of mid-sized companies^” it added.These observations are based on Crisil’s analysis of over 2^300 non-financial companies (from its rated portfolio) that availed of the moratorium to tide over the Covid-19 pandemic-induced cash-flow challenges^ after categorising them by rating^ sector and size. It revealed divergent trends.Subodh Rai^ Senior Director^ Crisil Ratings^ said^ “Companies in sectors impacted the most by the pandemic have been the keenest to avail of the moratorium. While every sector has been affected by the dislocations stemming from the pandemic^ majority of those with lower resilience have availed of the moratorium. Few among the more-resilient ones have done so.”Crisil assessed that every fifth company in highly-impacted sectors such as gems and jewellery^ hotel^ auto components^ automobile dealers^ power (power utilities^ independent power producers and energy traders)^ packaging^ and capital goods and components availed of the moratorium.On the other hand^ only one in 10 did from less-impacted sectors such as pharmaceuticals^ chemicals^ FMCG^ secondary steel and agriculture.“Size has also been a differentiator with few relatively bigger businesses going for it. In the mid-sized corporate segment (₹300-1^500-crore turnover)^ the number of companies availing the moratorium was more than thrice those in the ₹1^500-crore and above turnover range^” the agency said.Moratorium endsWhile the moratorium ends today^ Crisil is of the view that demand outlook in most sectors remains muted.

2020-08-26,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/invest-in-quality-stocks/article32448641.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Invest in quality stocks,Amidst the irrepressible Covid-19 pandemic^ the stock indices have witnessed a sharp fall. Over 300 stocks in S&P BSE 500 index fell by 60-80 per cent. Frantic with such market conditions^ investors hurried to park their money in gold. But even though the stock markets are volatile and liable to such sudden falls^ in the long run^ equities have always performed better. The CAGR of gold from 1981 to 2020 was merely 8.5 per cent^ with silver at 6.9 per cent. But the NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex indices grew at around a 14 per cent CAGR^ outperforming even the treasury bonds^ public provident funds (PPFs)^ and fixed deposits (FDs) by a wide margin.Usually^ gold is considered a popular investment choice because it acts a safety net and tends to appreciate in value during market turmoil. So^ people run to purchase gold as equities drop. But this protection and price gains average out in the long run due to limited movement in gold prices during normal times. On the other hand^ equities have a much higher compounding effect and provide greater returns in the long run. Further^ carefully selected stocks can provide gold-like safety nets and also deliver higher returns than equity indices.These stocks have a few common characteristics among them^ such as never-ending demand for their products and services; steady business management; and non-cyclicality^ in the sense that such stocks are not affected to a large extent by the cycles a stock market goes through. If we look around our household^ we find certain staple goods that will always be demanded for daily use — minerals (salt)^ toiletries and personal care items^ food and even the Internet^ which has upgraded from a luxury to a necessity. In the Indian markets^ firms like Hindustan Unilever^ ITC^ and Nestle are great examples of companies that sell fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) products. Even at the worst of worst conditions^ services and goods provided by these companies will always be sought after.Investing in such solid companies will provide higher return than that yielded by gold over the long run. It is important to note here that the aim is not multi-bagger wealth creation but to create value-protection that performs better than gold^ PPFs^ and FDs.Apart from FMCGs^ pharmaceutical stocks also contribute to protection. Especially at a time like now^ when a new-found cure or a vaccine is the only complete solution to kick-start normalcy again^ investing in pharmaceutical companies can been seen as a safe bet. Also^ medicines and hospital services are basic necessities of human life; hence^ we can count on these stocks being unaffected due to perennial demand for their services.Currently^ the gold prices in India are soaring. They have increased by almost 30 per cent in June alone. These price hikes make it harder for people to purchase gold assets and jewellery amid prevailing unemployment rates and falling disposable income levels. Moreover^ an average person finds it easier and hassle-free to buy gold in the form of jewellery at a store of their choice than in other forms such as gold exchange traded funds^ electronic gold or sovereign gold bonds. These issues further implies the need to look for quality equity stocks.Hence^ as an alternative to gold^ well-analysed and researched quality equity stocks are the best bets given the risk appetite. The benefits of such an investment is double-fold — it protects the portfolio’s value against severe market movements and at the same time yields higher returns than so-called safe avenues such as gold^ PPFs and FDs.Janani is a researcher^ IIM-Bangalore^ and Parthajit is assistant professor^ Madras School of Economics,26,08

The points have been well presented and the readiness of the reopening of economy is already established. Agreed^ in the present situation^ Mohammad must go to mountain^ but all these peaks are in the metros and the top cities. In India^ there are more ‘hillocks and pebbles’ (rural areas) that are still left unexplored by FMCG companies; people in these areas will better appreciate these products.The new normal provides huge potential for such marketing activities. A lot of consumers have just shifted to small towns^ and if they get the same brands that are present in the big cities and metros^ demand and consumerism will sky-rocket.KS RaghavanMumbaiGlobal competitivenessThis refers to ‘Two cheers for Modi’s I-Day speech’ (August 20). The Prime Minister indeed struck the right chord in his his seventh Independence Day speech^ but indeed^ the ground realities are not aligned with his claims. There is absolutely no harm in pitching for a self-reliant Bharat^ but for this^ we need major reforms^ as today our companies hardly make a product that meets global standards. We will have to create clusters across the country to boost sector-specific ecosystems which can cater to both domestic and global needs. As far as the National Infrastructure Pipeline is concerned^ undoubtedly it has huge potential^ but then the bottlenecks need to be addressed. But Modi needs to be applauded for at least realising that there is a need to shift away from protectionism.Bal GovindNoidaProceed with cautionThis refers to ‘Hotels^ restaurants^ weekly markets allowed to reopen in Delhi’ (August 20). The reported decision of the Lieutenant Governor of National Capital Territory of Delhi to allow the opening of hotels and restaurants must have come as a major relief for the hospitality industry^ as it will enable a much-needed revival and also help sustain the livelihood of many employees affected by the lockdown. Moreover^ the Hotel Association of India is also stated that it is set to resume operations as per the new norms. One earnestly hopes that the capital’s hotel industry will duly honour all such commitments.However^ the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s simultaneous move to allow the operations of weekly markets^ though on some trial basis^ may possibly serve as an open invitation for the coronavirus to spread again. Interestingly^ Delhi’s Health Minister Satyender Jain on Thursday announced that the second serological survey (based on 15^000 samples collected between August 1 and 7)^ showed that 29.1 per cent of people in Delhi have developed antibodies against the virus. But^ mind you^ the WHO had earlier cautioned against the Delhi government’s plea of ‘herd immunity’.S KumarNew DelhiVaccine nationalismThe extraordinary exuberance with which several developed countries such as the US^ the UK^ the European Union and Japan have entered into pre-purchase agreements with potential Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers has stoked genuine fears about “vaccine nationalism” and its discernible negative fallout on the global fight against the pandemic. The WHO has rightly flagged these concerns and affirmed its commitment to ensure equitable and broad access to Covid -19 vaccine through its initiative^ ‘Covax facility’. Through Covax facility^ it aims to procure two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of next year for deployment and distribution in the low- and middle-income countries. However^ there are several challenges. What we need at this critical juncture is not vaccine nationalism^ but global collaboration.M JeyaramSholavandan^ Tamil NaduWelcome moveThe decision of the Union Cabinet to set up a National Recruitment Agency to conduct a common eligibility test for recruitment for Central government jobs is a boon to the unemployed youth. It is also good that the scores remain intact for three years and also any number of attempts may be taken by the candidates for improvement in the scores. The online test also reduces the costs of the candidates.TSN RaoBhimavaram^ Andhra Pradesh,20,08
2020-08-20,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/r-srinivasan/pivoting-with-the-pandemic/article32396019.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Pivoting with the pandemic,This week was a fairly active one as far as activities went. With the rains finally setting in for some sustained activity in Delhi^ I bought myself — after trying out several — some good old Bata slippers with a strong^ non-slip sole. I also had a much-delayed haircut and had my wildly sprouting beard finally trimmed. I consulted a doctor about tweaking my medication for hypertension. And I finally managed to fulfil my craving for momos^ which I had not had since the first lockdown began in March^ as well as for mava cake^ a speciality of old-school Irani bakeries. And^ also shopped for some fresh groceries. A fairly humdrum set of activities you might think — and you would be right. Except for one significant difference — I did all of this without stepping outside of my gated community.The chappals were bought from a Bata mobile store^ which set up shop in my colony over the weekend. They didn’t bring mountains of stock^ but what they had was sensible and suited for the season — rubber and synthetic footwear^ sports shoes and no-nonsense ‘home’ footwear for women. And some clever marketing^ like pitching their washable footwear as ones where you can “wash away the virus”.My haircut^ beard trim and massage were performed by a young lad from Urban Company^ who brought his entire salon with him in a bag^ including single-use capes^ gloves and masks for him and me^ his own sanitiser and even a garbage bag to take the sweepings away. After five months of avoidance^ a haircut felt marvellous^ with the added comfort of overseeing the sanitisation process oneself in the safety of one’s own home.Ditto for the momos^ which were of the frozen^ ready-to-cook variety. Only^ they were ordered and delivered through a food delivery app which I had hitherto used only to order prepared food from restaurants. The cake came from a bakery^ which had tied up with a delivery service^ and the groceries from a speciality food store. And the doctor’s appointment was also virtual^ fixed and executed over my mobile phone.Smart improvisationThe Covid-19 pandemic sweeping the country has wreaked havoc with the economy. As the country reeled from one lockdown to another^ and later^ as cities struggled to cope with unlocking and resultant case load spikes^ businesses across the spectrum — from tiny ones like neighbourhood barbershops to giant manufacturing enterprises like automobile factories and airlines — faced unprecedented disruption in business as usual. The lockdown decimated brick-and-mortar retail^ destroyed the travel and hospitality sector and derailed services businesses as public transport went off the road.But those which managed to pivot quickly may actually be the front-runners in the post-Covid world. The IT sector^ for instance^ was one of the first to move^ migrating millions of knowledge workers to “work from home”^ while maintaining enterprise level security protocols.The shoes store coming to my colony is an equally interesting pivot. Footwear and apparel^ which is quite dependent on the physical “touch and try” experience (despite the inroads made by e-commerce) were hit — particularly in metros — by the closure of malls and retail spaces. By taking the store to the customer^ they are managing to reconnect with customers^ generate fresh business^ and more importantly^ keep their franchisees alive.Ditto for the food delivery apps. As the restaurants which generated the bulk of their business shut down^ they quickly shifted to leverage their core skill of delivery to handle everything from groceries to consumer non-durables to medicines. My “at home” haircut actually exemplifies the new normal: the “work from anywhere” approach. If the mountain cannot come to Mohammad^ Mohammad must go to the mountain — if your customers cannot come to you^ businesses must go to their customers.Post-Covid realitiesIn fact^ a new study released this week by PwC — titled ‘Full Potential Revival and Growth- Charting India’s medium-term journey’ — has found that the pandemic impact has triggered some unexpected convergences and synergies: the pharma sector using FMCG distribution chains for masks^ PPEs and sanitisers; or the government leveraging data from financial sector players to target assistance to MSMEs; or a delivery service partnering with FMCGs to restock stores.The PwC report suggests that “Organisations should look at two types of action — one related to volume of economic activity^ which can be achieved by deepening^ widening and heightening the organisation^ and the other related to improvements in productivity by formalising and digitalising.”It advocates corporates to look at “a decentralised structure that is able to deal with local situations^ rather than a centralised implementation structure”.While all this sounds quite encouraging^ one must bear in mind that the economy is far from having recovered from the shattering effect of the pandemic. We are — now that the first uptick of pent-up demand has been met post easing of restrictions — now entering our first major recession since 1979. Arguably almost every Indian household — except for the tiny fraction at the very top of the pyramid — has experienced some form of income destruction or job loss.This is going to profoundly alter consumer behaviour^ when it comes to both savings and investments. Leveraging technology and big data^ walking the extra mile to the customer’s door^ even changing the way you work — all of this can only help to some extent. Unless the consumer gets back confidence in the economy and her future prospects^ spending behaviour is likely to stay constrained. Even those businesses which have managed to react quickly — apart from those sectors which directly benefited from the pandemic like healthcare and pharma — are back to at best 30-40 per cent of the pre-Covid “normal”. It may be years before growth revives to pre-Covid averages^ if at all.Innovation on the flyCan this be changed? Can we make a faster comeback? PwC researchers believe it can^ if we adopt what they call a “whole-of-society” approach — where corporates^ citizens and government actively collaborate to reinvent the future.In my view^ that is too ambitious an ask. As a society and as a people^ we are more a nation of individual innovators rather than team players. Japanese ideas like kaizen and quality circles have been assiduously encouraged in India for decades but have had nothing like the kind of impact they have had in other Asian economies. We are simply not wired that way.Instead^ I have greater faith in our ability as a collective to innovate on the fly and to adapt very quickly to changed circumstances. It is not just the agile^ digitally-driven start-ups that are pivoting and innovating. Even legacy businesses are showing that they can change. Above all^ people have shown an astonishing capacity to adapt. Indian IT may have shifted six million workers to work from home^ but ordinary schools and teachers have managed to shift many times that number to online and virtual learning. It is this which gives one greater confidence that we can^ eventually^ overcome.,20,08
2020-08-17,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/jyothy-labs-eyes-debt-free-status-by-december/article32375510.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Jyothy Labs eyes debt-free status by December,Jyothy Labs^ owner of brands such as Ujala^ Margo^ Exo^ MAXO^ Henko and Pril^ is planning to be debt free by December. For Q1 FY21^ it saw a 34 per cent YoY rise in consolidated net profit to ₹50 crore^ a 2 per cent increase in total income to ₹437 crore and volume growth of about 6 per cent. According to Ullas Kamath^ Joint Managing Director^ Jyothy Labs^ consumer sentiments are “much more positive now when compared to April”. Neighbourhood stores or kiranas have made a big-time comeback^ he said. In an interview with BusinessLine^ Kamath spoke about the outlook for FY21^ rural recovery and buying patterns. Excerpts:How is the debt position of the company?As of now^ net debt is about ₹80 crore and it is around 3-4 months of net cash flows. At the current rate^ there is neither any planned capex nor any major investment plan. So^ ideally^ by the December quarter^ we should be debt-free.Is it possible to peg an outlook for remaining portion of FY21?It is difficult to predict numbers due to Covid19 uncertainties. However^ consumer sentiments are much more positive now than what they were at the beginning of the fiscal. Initially^ there was fear considering the (number of) global deaths and the rising number of positive cases. But then^ the worst affected countries like the UK^ Italy and China started recovering^ leading to improvement in sentiments in India. Now we see a near normal situation in consumption. Businesses^ especially ours (FMCG)^ are picking up. Earlier people were panic buying. Now^ almost normal buying is happening.Rural is doing well and there is no inventory hold for us. Yes^ there are intermittent or localised lockdowns. So we are seeing some ups and downs. But^ that will be the case for this fiscal^ I guess.In localised lockdowns^ last mile delivery from retailers (to consumers) gets affected. But^ people generally stock up since announcements are in advance. Even in lockdowns^ grocery items are categorised as essentials^ similar to milk and medicines.If there is a serious second wave and a prolonged lockdown happens^ fear may set in again. But we are well equipped to manage the situation with our experience. At the moment^ positive news of vaccine trials is giving hope to all.Did you notice any change in buying patterns?While rural people are looking at lower unit packs^ the trend is reversed in urban areas. People here (urban) are opting for larger or family packs^ as they want to limit their time at stores. Moreover^ some consumer down-trading is happening but mostly within the same brand. We are witnessing huge demand for ₹5 and ₹10 packs (smaller SKUs) of Exo and Margo.What has been your fastest moving product this time?Dishwashing products like bars and liquids — Exo and Pril — have seen very healthy uptick. The category has grown for all. Increased usage led to a 16 per cent YoY growth for Jyothy Labs in the category.But weren’t Margo sales below expectations?Yes^ a quarter-on-quarter trend looks somewhat flattish. But consumption has gone up in May and June. April was bit negative as sales got affected in major markets like Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Historically^ these are our strongest markets. Lockdowns in both these States affected our sales in April.Trucks and labourers were not available across Margo facilities in Guwahati^ which affected movement into West Bengal. We could not supply to Tamil Nadu with our offerings from the Puducherry facility.Margo sanitisers and hand washes have also grown (in sales) in July. It’s a ‘one basin^ one handwash bottle’ phenomenon at homes. Hand sanitisers are the norm in offices or when people are going out. We are exploring ways to ramp up production capacities for sanitisers. Both handwashes and sanitisers will stay as a serious category post the pandemic.How has the demand been for fabric wash?We have main wash (detergent powders and washing machine offerings) and post-wash products (fabric whiteners and Crisp & Shine). Post wash is affected^ as a category^ with people not going out much.Main wash is doing well^ but sales have been affected at modern trade outlets and canteen stores department. Malls and big retailers had issues in re-opening and supplies. But^ even in places which were open^ consumer behaviour was more to avoid large format stores or crowded hypermarkets. General trade did extremely good (sales) for us and partially made up for the loss in other formats.,17,08

Corporate earnings plunged more than 42 per cent (YoY) in the June quarter as everything remained shut due to Covid for much of the period. Based on the results declared so far^ by 1^495 companies^ the topline of listed entities (excluding banks and finance firms) was down 33 per cent in the first quarter compared to the corresponding period last year.Almost all sectors^ barring banks and financials^ insurance^ agro-chemicals^ pharmaceuticals^ and information technology^ reported a steep decline in their topline. The worst hit were companies in the hospitality and travel industry. Despite domestic air travel resuming from May 24^ InterGlobe Aviation (operator of IndiGo Airlines) reported an 88 per cent decline in total revenues. The company ended the June quarter with a net loss of ₹2^844.3 crore compared to a net profit of ₹1^203.1 crore in the June 2019 quarter.With the lockdown stalling production and consumers curtailing discretionary spends^ some automobile companies also reported huge losses. The market leader^ Maruti Suzuki^ posted its first quarterly loss — of ₹249 crore — in over a decade^ following an 80 per cent fall in volumes and revenues in the June quarter.Non-discretionary consumption^ however^ remained buoyant even during the lockdown. This aided FMCG companies. Hindustan Unilever reported a 3.6 per cent and 5.7 per cent (YoY) increase in total income and net profit^ respectively.Despite additional Covid related provisioning^ banks managed to report healthy earnings growth. This was mainly due to a low earnings base (2019 June quarter) and optical respite on the asset quality front due to the six-month moratorium on loans granted to borrowers. Private lender HDFC Bank reported a 19.6 per cent jump in the profit-after-tax^ on the back of healthy growth in loan book and stable margins.Info-tech companies saw a 2.6 per cent growth in profits^ despite a moderate 4.5 per cent growth in aggregate revenues. This was due to higher employee related costs.Margins inch upAmid weak demand and sales^ a tight rein on costs aided margins of manufacturing companies. In the June quarter^ these companies reported a jump in operating margins. Of the 1^495 companies that have reported numbers for the June quarter^ 906 were from the manufacturing sector. The operating margins of these companies rose to 18 per cent in the June quarter compared to 10 per cent in March 2020.With lower production volumes^ direct costs such as on raw materials and power and fuel fell 51 per cent and 28 per cent^ respectively^ compared to the June quarter last year.Cash-strapped^ many companies resorted to cost-cutting measures such as reduced advertisement spends^ furloughs and pay-cuts. This is evident from the decline in the selling and administration expenses and employee costs of the manufacturing companies^ which were down by 19 per cent and 7 per cent^ respectively.However^ in absolute numbers^ the operating profits were down 25 per cent compared to the June 2019 quarter. Aside from fixed costs weighing on the earnings^ a 2.2 per cent increase in interest costs dampened profits. However^ a 34 per cent drop in the tax outgo^ owing to companies moving to the new (lower) tax structure^ helped cushion the blow.The overall earnings trend can alter going forward^ with many companies yet to report their numbers for the June quarter.,17,08
2020-08-16,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/stock-fundamental-analysis-india/what-makes-mahindra-logistics-a-good-bet-over-the-long-term/article32368148.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,What makes Mahindra Logistics a good bet over the long term?,The outbreak of Covid-19 has hugely impacted the logistics sector^ with labour and motor vehicle drivers becoming unavailable and demand environment turning weak.Mahindra Logistics^ too^ has been severely impacted during the lockdown^ catering only to the logistics requirements of essential products. In the June quarter^ the company’s revenues fell by 54 per cent y-o-y ^ and it reported a net loss of ₹ 16.6 crore as against a net profit of ₹18.6 crore a year ago.But sanguine rural demand outlook^ stable business from Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M)^ focus on warehousing (that aids higher margins) and negligible debt levels augur well for the company in the coming months.By June^ the company’s revenues reached 70 per cent of pre-Covid levels. That aside^ amid the pandemic-led disruption in the fragmented logistics sector^ consolidation could well be on the cards.Mahindra Logistics will be one of the significant beneficiaries in the third-party logistics segment in such a scenario.That said^ the valuations are not cheap. At the current price^ Mahindra Logistics trades at over 50 times its one-year forward earnings estimate (as per Bloomberg)^ against a two-three- year historical average of about 47 times.While higher valuation and near-term growth headwinds could limit the upside in the short run^ long- term investors can start accumulating the stock.M&M’s backingMahindra Logistics^ an asset-light business^ was formed in 2007-08^ initially catering to the logistics business of M&M.Today^ the company operates in two segments — supply chain management (SCM — almost 90 per cent of FY20 revenues) and public transportation system (transport services provided by corporates to its employees — 10 per cent of revenues).Mahindra group and non-Mahindra clients constituted 55 per cent and 45 per cent^ respectively^ of SCM revenues in FY20. M&M’s share in revenues was much higher in FY19 at 65 per cent^ before the onset of auto slowdown.Mahindra Logistics provides almost the entire logistics requirements of Mahindra group’s agri and farm division.Going ahead^ the demand for farm equipment (tractors) is expected to be sanguine^ thanks to signs of pick-up in rural activity.With high exposure to rural markets^ M&M is well-positioned to benefit from rural recovery^ considering its dominance in the tractor segment.Despite the lockdown^ M&M has revived its production and its plants are operating at over 80 per cent capacity; over 90 per cent of the farm segment dealers of M&M have restarted business after the lockdown^ according to the management.Diversification plansOn the non-Mahindra client side^ besides the auto segment^ Mahindra Logistics has been steadily building its presence in the e-commerce^ freight forwarding^ pharma and consumer segments. These segments formed about 34.6 per cent of SCM revenue in FY20 (against 29.5 per cent a year ago).In FY20^ the company added 25-30 clients^ mostly in non-auto segments. Going ahead^ the management expects a similar or higher addition in clients. The company has about 300 customers (across all segments) as at the end of March 2020.Higher logistics business from non-Mahindra clients (especially FMCG^ e-commerce) is expected to bring higher warehousing revenues^ which provides higher gross margins.Generally^ margins from warehousing and other value- added services are higher than that from transportation.The blended operating profit margin of the company in FY20 was 4.56 per cent. Demand for additional warehouses is expected to increase going ahead with continued demand for essential products such as FMCG^ pharma and e-commerce — an expected big beneficiary of the impact of Covid-19.The management guided to add 1.5 million sq ft of warehousing space to the existing ~16.5 million sq ft in FY21.

2020-08-14,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/counterfeiting-costs-india-1-lakh-crore-every-year-ennoventure-ceo/article32358558.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Counterfeiting costs India ₹1 lakh crore every year: Ennoventure CEO,Covid-19 has enhanced the use of digital technologies in almost all sectors^ but such technologies can also be used to create and sell fake products and services. Often^ consumers are caught unaware of the fakeness of the products they are using. Anti-counterfeit technologies can make a big difference here by enabling companies to safeguard their products and services. BusinessLine spoke to Padmakumar Nair^ Founder and CEO of digital solutions provider Ennoventure^ to know about the latest anti-counterfeit technologies and their market opportunities in India.Not many are familiar with the idea of anti-counterfeit technology. What’s it all about?With the digital revolution^ more and more people are moving into contactless purchases and delivery mechanisms. Since March 2020^ online shopping has grown 74 per cent^ as a recent study on consumer behaviour post-Covid done by Nielsen^ Caravan and EY has found out.But the transformation brings threats as well. More than 30 per cent of the drugs we purchase online are fake. More than a million people die every year from counterfeit drugs. With the advances in computer vision and machine learning^ it is very easy to copy the design of products packaging making it very difficult for consumers to find the authenticity of the products. The global economic value of counterfeit is expected to reach 2.3 trillion dollars by 2020. Companies have invested heavily on anti-counterfeit technologies to counter this menace. But most technologies don’t reach the end consumers.What are the latest trends in anti-counterfeit tech?One of the trends that I noticed is that for the millenials the fake is the new normal. In a country like India^ economics is the key factor in purchasing expensive high-end brands. One of the modern cultural trends is that we seem to value access to high-end or high-value brands more than the ownership^ so we sign up to different music online/websites or movies online/websites because we want the ability to access music more than we do the physical CDs^ etc. Buying a fake designer watch^ expensive designer suit or cosmetics is the same: simply because we value the status the brand accords over the thing itself.There are two types of anti-counterfeit technologies: Overt: Something visible like a hologram^ watermark^ barcode^ QR code; Covert: Not visible to naked eyes. Only using special devices you can identify the hidden codes or information. With Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain taking the center stage^ more and more solutions are coming up employing these technologies.What's the potential of this market in India?In 2015^ FICCI CASCADE (Committee Against Smuggling and Counterfeiting Activities Destroying the Economy) released a study that says the government lost nearly Rs 6^000 crore to the grey market of FMCG personal goods.The report also mentioned that 31.6 per cent of FMCG personal goods space is spurious. Nearly 20 per cent of road accidents in India are attributed to fake automotive components^ says a study by Nielsen and ACMA (Automotive Component Manufacturing Association Of India). The auto aftermarket is worth ₹40^000 crore. Fakes account for 36 per cent of the pie. Nearly 30 per cent of the drugs sold in India are fake.Drugs prescribed for cold and cough or a headache are mostly either fake or of poor quality. According to a report released by the World Health Organization in 2017^ about 10.5 per cent of medicines sold in low and middle-income countries^ including India^ are substandard and falsified.Globally anti-counterfeit solutions are expected to reach $120 billion by 2025. The Authentication Solution Providers’ Association (ASPA)^ a self-regulated industry body of Anti-Counterfeiting and Traceability Solutions providers^ has reported that counterfeiting incidents have risen steadily in the last few years and in 2019 these have increased by 24 per cent as compared to 2018.The top sectors that see the most numbers of counterfeit cases include currency^ FMCG^ pharma^ content^ farming^ infrastructure^ auto and lifestyle. Amongst these^ currency^ alcohol and FMCG continue to be the top three sectors with the highest counterfeit incidents in the last two years. FMCG is the most vulnerable of the lot. Counterfeit incidents in the sector went up 63 per cent between 2018 (79) to 2019 (129). Counterfeit products across various sectors in India are causing over ₹1 lakh crore every year to our economy.How Ennoventure is trying to contribute to this ecosystem? What's your USP?Ennoventure has come up with a revolutionary technology that can encrypt any information on packaging. The encrypted information is completely invisible to the naked eyes. The technology is patented in the US and it uses AI^ cryptography and blockchain. It is a completely cloud-based SaaS solution which companies can implement without any investments in machinery.Ennoventure’s solution connects all stakeholders in the value chain right from the manufacturer to distributor to retailer to consumer and they can scan the product using their smartphone and validate the authenticity. Ennoventure is enabling the facility even on WhatsApp and consumers can upload the image to a specific number and get the authenticity of the product in seconds.How's this going to help Digital India?Counterfeiting activities are not limited to high-end luxury items. Day-to-day items including cumin seeds^ mustard cooking oil^ ghee^ hair oil^ soaps^ baby care vaccines and medicine are increasingly reported counterfeited by criminals.A spike in cases being reported about fake hand sanitizers^ masks^ and PPE kits has been observed during the Covid crisis. Between February and April 2020^ more than 150 plus cases of counterfeit incidents had been reported including fake PPE kits^ sanitizers and masks.With the digital explosion in telecom^ data penetration is scaling new heights on a monthly basis. India already has 450 million WhatsApp users and more and more consumers want to know the authenticity and provenance of the products they are buying. Ennoventure wants to give the power back to the consumers using our revolutionary technology. It is not just an anti-counterfeit solution^ it can provide more information about the product like videos on how to use^ composition^ side effects.What are the existing challenges to the growth of this tech in India and globally?Most of the solutions that are available today require a lot of investment in machinery and are overt in nature. Companies don’t like to invest in these technologies as it disrupts the existing processes within the organization. Also^ anything visible has a maximum shelf life of three months and by then criminals copy it. Due to these reasons^ companies resist the adoption of these technologies unless it’s forced by governmental bodies.Tell us about Ennoventure's past^ present and plans for the future.Ennoventure was incorporated in Delaware in the US in 2018. Ennoventure Technologies^ fully-owned subsidiary was incorporated in March 2020 to drive global research and development. Ennoventure has been selected by Microsoft for Startups and the collaboration enables placement of Ennoventure’s technology in Microsoft’s Azure marketplace. In addition to that Microsoft will co-sell the product using their sales channels. In 2020 Dubai Future Foundation has shortlisted Ennoventure as one of the promising global startups in the space of AI.Ennoventure has taken a conscious decision to focus on India as it is the global leader in the export of generic drugs. Ennoventure is entering the US and European markets in Q4 2020.,14,08

There has also been a severe demand compression due to the lockdown and closing down of educational institutions^ commercial establishments and downstream printers^ publishers^ converters^ stationery services among others.”“Even after the lifting of the lockdown^ the situation has not improved much with only a small pick-up in demand. The country’s paper industry is currently operating at less than 50 per cent capacity utilisation due to the sever demand compression and cheap imports flooding into the country^” he told BusinessLine.Challenging conditionsThe paper industry is operating under extremely challenging conditions which have been compounded by substantial quantities of paper being imported into the country at significantly lower costs^ especially due to the Free Trade Agreements such as India-ASEAN FTA and Indo-Korean CEPA and other trade agreements like Asia Pacific Trade Agreements^ which includes China.“The country’s paper sector^ which registered a growth of about 5-6 per cent last fiscal ended March 31^ 2020^ is likely to see a de-growth this financial year with poor sales volumes in the first quarter and the ongoing second quarter^ where the situation has not improved much. However^ the business may take at least couple of more quarters. In a fair assessment^ things may get back to normalcy by next year^” Mehta said.“Among various business segments within the paper industry^ the packaging industry has fared well across segments - pharma sector^ FMCG and growth of the e-commerce business. However^ the education^ office and commercial segments have been adversely hit^” he said.The imports of paper and paperboards^ barring the newsprint into the country^ have been steadily increasing. In the last nine years^ imports have risen at a CAGR of 11.34 per cent in value terms from ₹3^411 crore in 2010-11 to ₹8^972 crore in 2019-20. The imports as per estimates are growing at a very high rate as compared to the increase in domestic production rate with underutilisation of domestic installed capacity.However^ the biggest hope for the industry is the potential for the per capita paper consumption going up from the present 14 kg to about 17 kg by 2024-25. The global average per capita consumption is about 57 kg.The industry is hoping that the Covid-19 pandemic fades away and business gets back to normalcy with schools^ educational institutions^ commercial establishments functioning normally within couple of months^ so that it would trigger industry volume growth again.,14,08

The local stores faced a mass reduction in foofalls^ which directly affected their sales due to restrictions in movement.Additionally^ going cashless was also a major concern^ especially in Tier-II and -III cities.In such a scenario^ B2B e-commerce platforms came to the forefront to help kirana stores with digitisation. Here are four start-ups which are helping local stores go online:MaxWholesaleMaxWholesale is a B2B e-commerce platform which helps kirana stores source inventory online. It helps kirana stores discover prices and schemes on various FMCG brands and products^ and order the same for reselling.MaxWholesale claims to ensure that all orders placed on the platform are delivered to the kirana stores within 24 hours of placing. For this^ the platform operates its own warehousing and logistics infrastructure.With MaxWholesale’s “MaxPe”^ kirana stores can pay directly from their bank without any additional cost^ the company mentioned.Paytm MallPaytm Mall has recently partnered with over 10^000 kirana stores^ small shops^ and other businesses for hyperlocal deliveries.It enables small businesses digitally by allowing them to sell essentials on Paytm Mall and giving them all the necessary logistics support required.The company is aiming to help shops and stores which have either noticed a sharp decline in footfall or had to abruptly pause operations due to the lockdown.Paytm Mall has started connecting them with their logistics partners so that these small kirana shops and stores can deliver essentials to their customers.ShopmaticShopmatic is a Singapore-based technology firm that provides e-commerce solutions to small businesses and individual entrepreneurs.The company recently partnered with Singapore-based retail management solutions company Octopus to disrupt the retail market in Asia-Pacific with a suite of services to address the gaps in helping offline businesses go online.The synergy is helping local retailers implement an efficient omni-channel retail management system post establishing their business online.ShopKiranaShopKirana is a B2B e-commerce company focussed on technology and supply chain innovation that aims to empower retailers to be competitive by providing technology^ operational expertise^ and scale advantage.ShopKirana stated that it directly works with brands to give them a boost on the demand side and reach to masses with transparency and deep market intelligence.,14,08

The new range has been launched exclusively on Amazon during its Prime Day Sale.Earlier the company’s presence in the baby care segment was through products such as Dabur Lal Tail and Gripe water. But with its latest range of products^ it is vying for a bigger pie of the fast-growing baby care segment in the country.In a statement^ Ajay Singh Parihar^ Marketing Head-Healthcare OTC^ Dabur India Ltd^ said: “With the growing demand for baby care products^ we have decided to expand the Dabur Baby Care portfolio with a range of products enriched with Ayurvedic herbs. We are committed to offering the safest Ayurveda-based solutions for the health and well-being of every household.”“The Dabur Baby range of products do not have any harmful chemicals and is another step forward in this direction of launching products^ which are based on the age-old knowledge of Ayurveda but available in modern-day convenient format^” he added.Smerth Khanna^ E-commerce Head at Dabur India^ added that the company leveraged on insights and data available through various online channel partners on the global online baby products markets and assessing the needs of young parents. “Staying true to our roots at Dabur^ we have created this Baby Care range that focusses on novel natural ingredients^ free of chemicals and is gentle on the baby^” he added.Immunity vansThe home-grown FMCG major on Friday also announced the launch of ‘Dabur Immunity Vans’^ which is an initiative aimed at taking its range of Ayurvedic medicines and products closer to consumer households. “These specially designed vans^ which is part of Dabur’s direct-to-consumer ‘Immunity at your Doorstep’ initiative^ have been deployed across 10 cities in India to give consumers access to immunity-boosting products at their doorsteps^” the company said in a statement.In the first phase^ Dabur has deployed 12 Immunity Vans in Lucknow^ Kanpur^ Varanasi^ Indore^ Bhopal^ Nagpur^ Jabalpur^ Ludhiana^ Bilaspur^ Jaipur^ Patna and Raipur. “These specially designed vans are moving around residential localities and government offices^ among other places^ in these cities^” Dabur added.,07,08
2020-08-06,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/catalyst/how-brands-drove-salience-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/article32287959.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,How brands drove salience during the coronavirus pandemic,"Over the last three months^ as the Covid-19 outbreak peaked^ homegrown FMCG firm Dabur rolled out over 40 new products and variants.Most of them were immunity-boosting products or hygiene products such as sanitisers that were linked to customer needs during the pandemic.Godrej Consumer Products too did many launches during this period. Particularly noteworthy was a personal and home hygiene range of 12 products clubbed together under the Godrej Protekt brand. It includes soap^ body wash^ fruit and vegetable wash^ dish-washing liquid^ hand-sanitiser sachet^ air and surface disinfectant spray^ anti-bacterial wipes and face masks.Another agile mover was ITC^ which launched fruit beverages with immunity offerings under its B Natural+ brand. It also came out with a slew of hygiene solutions under the Savlon brand^ including sanitisers in sachet format priced at just 50 paise.Noticing how consumers were seeking convenience^ it also unleashed a range of unique frozen snacks under the ITC Master Chef brand.Even MNCs — usually notoriously slow on the product launch front — pushed new offerings. Take Coca-Cola^ which launched Minute Maid Vita Punch^ a range of fruit cocktails enriched with Vitamin C to support immunity and scaled up Minute Maid Nutriforce^ a Kashmiri apple juice fortified with iron^ zinc and other essential vitamins. It also launched its Vio Spiced Buttermilk as a hyperlocal offering.Speedy launchesAs the Covid-19 pandemic hit India^ it is interesting to see how the strategy of FMCG companies shifted^ especially in terms of new product launches. No longer did they indulge in the luxury of doing sampling^ pilot testing in one region first^ agonising over branding and communication for ages.Instead^ they showed rare agility^ innovating quickly^ experimenting with new products^ packs^ pricing^ and changing their distribution strategy in an attempt to stay relevant with their consumers.That was perhaps the only way to retain brand salience in a challenging period where consumer loyalty depended on factors like availability and meeting of new needs. The consumer was changing and it was imperative for the companies to change too.As Sunil Kataria^ CEO-India & SAARC^ Godrej Consumer Products^ points out^ the company completely re-imagined its approach to innovation and new product development. “Our teams across the globe cross-pollinated ideas and technology to launch new sanitiser and hand wash ranges in record speed^ ranging from 10 days to a month^” he says.Dabur India too adapted. Chief Executive Officer Mohit Malhotra explains how they totally changed the way the organisation worked^ adapting the existing policies and procedures. “We needed to be agile and seize opportunities in a very short time frame. We had to quickly adapt our business approach^ mobilise our teams to put in a strong effort despite lockdown restrictions^ besides leveraging technology and innovation to address the changing environment and the emerging needs of our consumers^” he says.Supply chain innovationsDuring the initial days of the lockdown^ when supply chains were badly disrupted^ FMCG companies that had traditionally been laggards on digital realised the significance of e-commerce. Many of them co-created products with e-commerce players and launched online first products. Take^ for example^ Godrej’s Hit Anti-Mosquito Racquet or Dabur Himalayan Apple Cider Vinegar.Companies also quickly tied up with new entrants in essential products distribution^ such as Swiggy^ Zomato and Dunzo^ to strengthen last-mile deliveries.They exploited new channels too. Godrej partnered with the Indian Railways’ Central Railway zone to promote travel hygiene among passengers and rail employees. “Two lakh products of our new range like hand-sanitiser sachets^ and on-the-go disinfectant spray will be used in passenger trains. Our air and surface disinfectant spray will be used to disinfect surfaces of ticket booking counters as well^” says Kataria. Coca-Cola India also tied-up with Common Services Centres to list its products on the Grameen eStore platform.For ITC^ which was one of the speediest in realigning its distribution infrastructure^ a clear innovation was a store on wheels to reach customers directly. The company also tied up with diverse companies such as Domino’s and Amway besides going for other e-commerce tie-ups to take its products to consumers.Coca-Cola India too phenomenally scaled up its ability to operate on e-commerce and grocery channels.Companies like Coca-Cola took stock of purchase moments. For the beverage giant^ out-of-home occasions^ especially in the summer months^ are huge sales drivers. T Krishnakumar^ President^ Coca-Cola India and South-west Asia^ said the company is trying to see how it could help consumers replicate or simulate the away-from-home occasions experience at-home.Krishnakumar also said^ “We are focusing on creating more affordable versions of our existing products so consumers can pick them up for home.” The company had been working on sprucing up its product development strategies to be able to launch a product in under 12 weeks^ over the past two years.Becoming fearlessThe Covid-19 crisis seems to have taught companies to take more risks. As Malhotra of Dabur says^ “We have transformed ourselves as an organisation^ become more aggressive and fearless. We have also enhanced our risk-taking ability^ encouraging our employees to become more entrepreneurial.”The notable change^ as he sums up^ is the agility.“As a company^ we were pursuing perfection. As a result^ we used to keep working on new products and delaying their launch to achieve perfection. I believe the crisis has made us more progressive. I feel it is okay if you are not perfect^ as long as you remain progressive towards perfection.""",06,08
2020-08-06,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/mpc-prepares-for-long-haul-to-recovery/article32287440.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,MPC prepares for long haul to recovery,Despite some notable contrarian opinions in this regard^ a majority of the analysts and market participants believed that the MPC would keep the policy rate unchanged at 4 per cent in its meeting that concluded on August 6. After all^ the effectiveness of another rate cut on top of the cumulative 115 basis-point cut in the previous two meetings that were arranged off-cycle^ resulting in an aggregate rate reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019^ in boosting economic activity would have been minimal. Moreover^ it would be injudicious for the MPC to quickly expend its remaining rate-cutting firepower in the present situation^ when there are chances of further large shocks. However^ there was broad consensus that the MPC will majorly focus on the issue of growth revival in the economy through higher and better credit flow. An announcement of fresh measures for restructuring MSME loans affected by the Covid-19 pandemic was also expected. These have been largely met.The equity market rose^ while the 10-year benchmark G-Sec price fell a little bit after the policy.Growth and inflation dynamicsOverall^ the economy is likely to contract in 2020-21. Gradual restoration of supply chains after lockdown relaxations notwithstanding^ the demand conditions continue to be very weak: consumer confidence turned more pessimistic in July vis-à-vis the preceding round of the RBI’s survey. However^ the agricultural sector appears to be one bright spot^ both from supply as well as demand perspectives. The prospects of this year’s kharif output looks bright on the back of several important indicators. This follows the record production and procurement in the last rabi season. As pointed out by the MPC^ rural demand has received a boost by these developments^ as reflected in fertiliser production and the sales of tractors^ motorcycles and FMCG items. There are incipient signs to infer that the terms of trade are becoming more favourable for the primary sector as a whole^ which^ if correct^ needs to be supported by policy measures to strengthen this sector’s supply response and to lessen the reliance on the instrument of minimum support price.A growth revival in 2021-22 is possible^ but there are many ifs and buts: sustained uptick in demand should be observable in Q2 of the current fiscal and subsequently; no protracted spread of the pandemic; the monsoon behaving well; financial stability in India and abroad etc. All in all^ the risks seem to be stacked more on the downside^ indicating a long wait before the economy comes out of the red. The MPC is surely aware of such a possibility^ which is why it has pledged to maintain the current accommodative stance for as long as necessary.As per the provisional estimates^ headline CPI inflation rose to 6.1 per cent in June from 5.8 per cent in March. Inflation^ excluding food and fuel^ was at 5.4 per cent in June^ reflecting a spike in prices almost across the board. Headline inflation is likely to remain elevated in Q2 2020-21^ but may moderate in the second half of the fiscal^ aided by large favourable base effects. If headline inflation falls and growth headwinds persist^ the MPC will slash the rate further.Financial stability issuesThe RBI deserves some credit for alleviating stress in the financial markets and for building confidence in the wake of the pandemic outbreak^ which involved interventions for injecting short- and long-term rupee liquidity to the tune of ₹9.57 lakh crore or 4.7 per cent of the GDP.These have had three important outcomes: One^ despite the Central government’s market borrowing requirement for 2020-21 being raised from ₹7.1 trillion to ₹12 trillion^ the yield of the 10-year benchmark G-Sec did^ in fact^ register a moderate drop. Two^ the credit spread of the borrowings by entities across all the rating categories dropped significantly. Three^ corporates^ including NBFCs^ have borrowed record amounts at lower cost^ thereby putting an end to the liquidity crunch engendered by the IL&FS and DHFL defaults in 2018 and 2019 respectively.Mutual funds’ liquidity difficulties have also been addressed. The average lending rates on fresh loans of banks fell by 91 basis points during the March-June period. There is transmission of the monetary policy in the face of unprecedented disruptive shocks.Economic shock and PSB reformHowever^ a pertinent issue here is whether the real sector’s response has been in unison with the favourable conditions in the money and debt markets? The latest Financial Stability Report of the RBI provides some clue in this regard: One^ it acknowledges a growing disconnect between the movements in certain segments of the financial markets and real sector activity. Two^ it reveals that deleveraging by the private corporate sector stalled during the second half of 2019-20 with leverage increasing due to higher borrowings. Incremental borrowings were used for creating financial assets and not for capex formation^ as demand conditions remained muted. And the prices of gold and silver have surged in the recent months.One needs only to connect the dots to surmise what the short-term outcomes of the liquidity surge in India and elsewhere are likely to be^ keeping in mind the continued very sluggish growth in bank credit flow in India for more than a year. This can have adverse consequences for the government’s ₹21-lakh crore aid package to counter the effects of the pandemic^ since a sizeable portion of it depends on additional credit disbursement by banks. But as pointed out in the FSR^ all categories of banks^ including public sector banks (PSBs) have turned risk-averse^ as they are now increasingly discriminating between bad and good risks. This is good news for financial stability in India^ although it may not be so for fighting the pandemic.After the PSBs contend with the increase in their NPAs on the lifting of the current moratorium on loan servicing toward the end of this year^ and if they lend fully as per all the schemes that will be put in place — including those for restructuring to deal with the pandemic — their gross NPAs are likely to rise from the current 11.3 per cent to above 15 per cent in less than two years. This points towards a cruel trade-off^ that could have been done without^ if only the authorities implemented a thoroughgoing reform of PSBs when the going was good.In the FSR^ commitment to long-term financial stability on the part of the RBI reads like a mission statement. But it will make little difference if PSBs are not reformed.Through The Billion Press. The writer is a former central banker and consultant to the IMF,06,08

The Eastern region witnessed a decline of 31 per cent in terms of sales value growth in the April-May period compared with the same period last year but clocked a growth of 5 per cent in June.Sharang Pant^ Lead Vertical and RMS^ Nielsen Global Connect^ said incidence of Covid-19 cases per million and the levels of contribution of rural markets were the two factors that impacted growth trends of the FMCG sector across the four zones. “Higher rural population and lower incidence of Covid cases in East and North zone are also reflected in the FMCG industry growth trends. These two zones saw a shift from negative industry growth of April-May to a high single-digit growth in June^” he explained.Meanwhile^ the Southern region^ which clocked a decline of 23 per cent in terms of sales value growth in April-May^ recorded about 2 per cent growth in June^ compared with the same period last year. At the same time^ the Western region^ which witnessed the sharpest dip of 33 per cent in terms of value growth in the April-May period^ continued to be see a negative growth trajectory and sales value growth was down by 2 per cent even in June.“The West zone that has a relatively higher urban population and had higher severity of the pandemic continued to decline in June^” Nielsen stated. The incidence of Covid cases per million was also the highest in the West zone. Pant pointed out that Southern and Western zones are more urbanised and the contribution of rural regions is relatively lower compared to East and North zones.Overall^ the FMCG industry witnessed a 17 per cent y-o-y decline in sales value in the April-June period. In the April-May period^ the industry recorded a decline of 28 per cent. However^ as the country gradually moved towards unlocking of economic activity in June^ the industry clocked a value growth of 4.5 per cent.,05,08
2020-08-05,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/packing-industry-holds-potential-for-high-growth/article32275596.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Packing industry holds potential for high growth,The impact of Covid-19 on the packaging sector has been mixed depending on the portfolios of different end-user industries. The Indian packaging sector^ even in the pre-Covid era^ has been witnessing considerable growth largely due to increased globalisation of trade in goods and services and emergence of new trade models^ such as e-commerce and organised retailing.E-commerce in India is projected to grow rapidly at a CAGR of 27 per cent from 2017 to 2026 to reach $200 billion by 2026. This has been further boosted by the current pandemic due to closures of store retailing consequent to the lockdowns. With the projections of the impact of the pandemic to be long drawn^ consumer preferences towards e-commerce and e-retailing will continue to be a trend beyond the crisis. Currently^ India’s share in the overall parcel shipments (transit packaging) worldwide is less than 1 per cent.With steep growth of e-commerce and e-retailing globally^ and in India^ transit packaging and omni-channel packaging are emerging as the most potential segments — maintaining safety^ hygiene^ and integrity of goods — and where the Indian packaging industry has considerable scope for expansion.Whilst the closure of stores has reduced the need for disposable in-store packaging in the short term^ demand have shifted to alternative uses. In the food service segment^ disposable takeaway packaging options have registered higher demand as consumption patterns shift to food delivery. Emergence of new food businesses^ and local restaurants and food delivery giants launching their own delivery or food takeaway services are warranting new requirements of packaging.Growth forecastThe Indian packaging industry is expected to reach $72.6 billion by 2020^ growing at a CAGR of 18 per cent during 2016-21. Covid-19 may have derailed this growth considerably; however^ certain manufacturing sectors^ such as pharmaceuticals^ packaged food and beverages^ functional food and hygienic products among the FMCG^ have been less affected by the crisis^ and have rather seen a sizeable growth both in demand and in production^ raising the demand of packaging.By far with a low share of 1.4 per cent in global exports^ India is a net exporter of packaging materials. The export of packaging materials from India was estimated at $843.8 million in 2018-19^ witnessing a y-o-y growth of 14.1 per cent. India has emerged as market leader in quite a few sub-segments of packaging^ such as the Flexible Intermediate Bulk Container (FIBC) and Biaxially-oriented Polyethylene Terephthalate (BOPET) films.Nevertheless^ China dominates the sector and is the largest manufacturer and exporter of packaging materials and products globally. While the trade in the sector has been severely affected by the global pandemic lockdowns as in the case of other sectors^ the pandemic driven isolation of China have been forcing the packaging companies worldwide to relook at their supply chain vulnerabilities^ which is accelerating shifting of their businesses and sourcing to other second world countries^ preferably India.Despite limited activity in the packaging space in India^ historically^ the last decade has witnessed the Indian packaging industry emerging as an attractive investment avenue for the global players^ largely in the flexible packaging segment. Predominantly an unorganised set-up^ the flexible packaging industry has undergone a certain degree of consolidation in the recent years^ due to the acquisitions and mergers^ which has brought in much-needed investments in the industry in technology^ scale and skill development.Although M&A activity is likely to be more subdued in the short term due to the Covid disruptions^ as the economies recover^ the M&A activities are likely to be heightened in the medium to longer term^ as consolidation in the sector is anticipated to continue.Many challengesThe industry is constantly faced with several challenges in terms of cost^ technology^ knowledge^ regulations^ and environment. The changing economic conditions^ trade and market preferences imposed by the pandemic have added to the woes of the industry in the form of raw material shortages^ particularly seen in kraft paper based packaging^ imports of machineries^ and slowdown in production and commerce.Notwithstanding the challenges^ the growth drivers are distinctly defined for the industry even during this current crisis.

The industry is expected to witness flat growth in full year of 2020 given the unprecedented dynamics of the market after severe nationwide Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown^ closure of stores and disruption in supply chain that impacted demand in the April-June quarter.In April^ the market research and insights firm had projected an annual growth rate of 5-6 per cent for the FMCG sector. However^ Nielsen has now slashed its annual growth forecast to a flat growth range of -1 to 1 per cent. It said that the “bellwether FMCG industry which was trying to revive from a tough 2019 year^ was significantly hit in the April-June period with a 17 per cent decline in sales value growth compared to the same quarter of 2019.” Prasun Basu^ South Asia Zone President^ Nielsen Connect said this was the worst quarter the FMCG industry has witnessed in a long time.In April-May period^ the industry recorded a decline in value growth by 28 per cent compared to same period last year. However^ as the country gradually moved towards unlocking economic activity in June^ the industry clocked a value growth of 4.5 per cent aided by opening of stores and normal consumption levels across categories.Nielsen expects this revival trend to continue in the second half of the year depending on factors such as curbing of spread of Covid-19. “ We are expecting to see more growth in fourth quarter than in third quarter due to revival of spends in the festival season. We won’t be surprised if Q3 delivers growth levels similar to the June growth^” Basu added.Rural outpaced urbanRural markets led the industry revival in June and clocked a value growth of 12 per cent over June 2019 and grew three times of all India FMCG growth^ Nielsen pointed out. “At an overall quarter level also^ rural markets were less impacted as compared to their urban counterpart (11 per cent decline for rural versus 20 per cent decline for urban)^” it added. Factors such as lower infection rates of Covid-19 in rural areas leading to lesser disruption in economic activity and retail stores opening^ normal monsoons and rural stimulus push by the government also contributed to this revival.Asked if the rural growth will sustain in the coming months^ Basu said^ “Rural has been comparatively more insulated from the pandemic compared to urban regions. We also expect to see positive impact on rural demand due to the reverse migration among other factors with the hopes that the pandemic spread does not intensify further in the hinterlands.”Meanwhile^ June also witnessed a bounce-back in demand for non-food categories such as personal care and home care.In the April-June quarter^ lockdown conditions impacted traditional stores and kiranas more than organised trade and e-commerce channels. “On entering the unlock phase^traditional trade regained its share of trade and e-commerce also jumped back to a high growth zone. Modern Trade^ meanwhile^ struggled with continued restrictions and lower footfalls due to social distancing adherence^” Nielsen report added.,30,07

The markets research and insights firm had in April said it expected the FMCG value growth to be in the range of 5-6 per cent for the calendar year.In the April-June period (Q2)^ the FMCG sector’s value growth declined by about 17 per cent^ due to the strict lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 pandemic adversely impacted supply chain and consumer demand^ it added.While in the April-May period^ value growth for the sector was down by 27.7 per cent^ as the country gradually began unlocking economic activities in June^ the FMCG sector saw some recovery with a value growth of about 4.5 per cent. The insights firm said that this was fuelled by recovery in rural demand and added that growth in rural markets outpaced urban markets.Nielsen expects consumer spends in the second half of the year to revive due to the festival season besides other macro-economic factors such as good monsoon. However^ this will also depend on Covid-19 infection cases and the strategy the country adops in further unlocking of economic activities.“We expect to see some recovery in the July-December period.We are expecting to see some growth in Q3 but we expect to see even better growth in Q4 due to the festival season.” said Prasun Basu^ South Asia Zone President^ Nielsen Connect,30,07
2020-07-26,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/stock-fundamental-analysis-india/why-britannia-industries-should-be-an-essential-part-of-your-portfolio/article32196704.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Why Britannia Industries should be an essential part of your portfolio,Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out^ the foods segment has been the main growth driver for FMCG companies. The June 2020 quarter volume growth (year-on-year) for Britannia Industries^ which came in at 21.5 per cent^ is a testimony to this.Early restart of production after the easing of lockdown and expansion as well as focus on select products that bring the maximum revenues paid off during the quarter.With the pandemic not seeming to go away soon^ in-home consumption is expected to continue to boost volumes for food companies in the near term^ and Britannia will be a beneficiary.Over the medium term^ Britannia’s efforts to become a ‘total foods company’ by improving its presence in allied sub-segments such as dairy^ wafers and croissants bode well for volumes as well as margins. With prospects being bright^ the stock has moved up sharply since the March 23 low^ gaining 80 per cent.However^ the valuation provides some comfort. Britannia trades at a discount to FMCG behemoth Hindustan Unilever^ which is slightly on back foot now^ considering that a chunk of its portfolio is in the discretionary consumption space.While HUL trades at 62 times its estimated earnings for FY21^ Britannia trades at 49 times. Investors can make use of corrections to buy the Britannia stock.Britannia has been able to tide over the pandemic-induced restraints during the April-June quarter by focussing on improving its reach as well as optimising production to suit demand. The company focussed on 20 per cent of the products that bring 80 per cent of the revenues — such as Milk Bikis^ Marie^ NutriChoice (digestive)^ Good Day and cream biscuits.This helped improve productivity and optimise costs^ and brought in better utilisation of manufacturing capacities. From around 19.7 lakh outlets as of March 2020^ the company improved its direct reach to 21.5 lakh outlets at the end of the June quarter.With the firm getting about 37 per cent of its revenues from rural areas^ the fact that rural India has been so far less impacted by the pandemic^ too^ helped Britannia. It added 3^000 preferred dealers in rural areas in the June 2020 quarter.With the modern trade channel being impacted due to closure of malls etc^ the company’s strong foothold in general trade (sale through local stores/smaller outlets) helped. Going forward^ the rise in in-home consumption is expected to continue in the near term given the localised restrictions on movement and eating out across the country.Expansion in offeringsLong-term prospects are also sanguine. While at least two-thirds of its revenues come from biscuits^ over the years^ the company has been diversifying its mix. In this context^ it is betting on its dairy business. Currently^ products such as cheese^ yoghurt and dairy whiteners are available. It recently extended its portfolio into value-added products such as dairy drinks — milk shakes and lassi.With a view to improving efficiencies and margins^ Britannia is expanding its back-end capabilities of the dairy business^ such as setting up a larger procurement pool for milk. Wafers and croissants are another area. But these businesses are quite small now^ contributing only about 2 per cent to overall revenues. The fragmented nature of the market for wafers and low market penetration of both these products vis-à-vis biscuits promise good prospects.To cash in on the demand for ‘natural’ and ‘wellness’ products ^ the company also plans to launch biscuits and dairy varieties fortified with vitamins^ minerals and also with natural ingredients such as ginger and turmeric.Margins expandFor the quarter ended June 2020^ the company recorded a 26.5 per cent growth (year-on-year) in consolidated sales to ₹3^384.46 crore. With volumes growing at 21.5 per cent^ the remaining came from price and superior mix.Operating margins improved sharply from ₹14.03 per cent to 20.9 per cent.Lower prices of inputs such as flour^ refined palm oil and milk helped.The company also cut down on advertising spends by about 200 basis points. Thanks to a strong operating performance^ consolidated profits doubled to ₹545 crore.With volumes growing by low single digits in 2019-20^ the lower base^ coupled with higher demand^ could continue to support volumes this fiscal.,26,07
2020-07-26,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/personal-finance/what-are-the-filters-used-by-marcellus-to-select-stocks-cio-saurabh-mukherjea-explains-in-exclusive-interview/article32196595.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,What are the filters used by Marcellus to select stocks? CIO Saurabh Mukherjea explains in exclusive interview,Investors need to do nothing different as they navigate the current patch^ says Saurabh Mukherjea^ founder and Chief Investment Officer^ Marcellus Investment Managers. All they need to do is to pick clean companies with strong franchises^ which will automatically compound investor returns. As Marcellus gets ready to launch its financial sector fund^ he explains the filters used by him to select stocks and the pitfalls to avoid^ in this exclusive interaction with BusinessLine.What are your thoughts on the current market scenario? The Nifty 50 is soaring above 11^000 despite the picture being so bleak on the economy and earnings…There is enough data now to question this narrative of things being bleak. Electricity and diesel demand has normalised. We are hearing from many FMCG and auto makers that demand has revived significantly. Banks such as HDFC Bank registered ^ credit growth of 7-8 per cent^ even in the June quarter. The wheels of the Indian economy did not come off even in the darkest days of the lockdown. A similar trend is witnessed in other countries in Europe and in the US too.If you a take 2-3 year view^ the picture is quite positive. In the last 40 years^ every single economic boom in our country was preceded by a recession in the US. This is due to two reasons. One^ a US recession makes oil prices fall by 60-70 per cent^ and that is conducive for an oil-importing nation like ours. The fall in oil prices is equivalent to a stimulus amounting to 3 per cent of our GDP. The second reason is that a US recession brings down the US treasury yields by 2- 3 per cent that eventually brings down interest rates India^ too. So^ over the next 2-3 year period^ we can have a period of accelerated economic growth^ similar to 2009-2011.But we have lost the entire month of April^ with no economic activity. So^ the growth for FY21 will shrink to that extent^ right?Look at it this way^ any stock price reflects 20 years of profits discounted. Assume that a company makes ₹5 of discounted profit every year^ so its price is ₹100 (₹ 20*5). Even if this year’s profits are wiped out^ the stock price should be ₹ 95 and that is what the stock market is reflecting now. Thankfully^ after the hysteria in March^ sanity has prevailed and the Nifty50 is 7-8 per cent below its January peak. So the Indian stock market is saying that this year’s profits are gone but from FY22 onwards^ activity will normalise.There is another more optimistic way to look at this. Say a good company that is a market leader gains 10 per cent market share because of the way Covid-19 has hit weaker companies. So^ instead of ₹5 for the next 19 years^ if they generate ₹5.50 for the next 19 years^ then the price of the stock should actually be ₹105.In your handbook^ ‘Investing Through a Crisis’^ you say that choosing companies with good governance is critical. Can you talk about the Marcellus forensic framework that you use to filter companies?What we were trying to highlight in the book^ ‘Investing Through a Crisis’^ is that irrespective of Covid-19^ the biggest risk in the Indian stock market comes from accounting fraud. Our analysis suggests that 80 per cent of companies in the Indian stock market fabricate their accounts to a greater or lesser extent. Focusing on the other 20 per cent that have clean account is extremely important for all investors in our country^ whether investing in debt or equity.In Marcellus forensic framework^ we use 10 accounting traps over previous six years of financial statements to filter companies. A simple trap is growth in audit fee divided by growth in revenues. If audit fee grow faster than revenue over 4-6 years^ it is a powerful indicator to show that the auditor is fabricating the accounts and the company would get a negative score in our framework.Another test we do is to see if a company that generates hefty profits over many years generates commensurate free cash-flow. Almost 70 per cent of Nifty 50 companies fail in this test^ they have not been able to generate any free cash-flow in the last decade.The cash conversion ratio is quite important. This shows how much cash flow the company generates for every ₹100 of operating profit. The company’s ratio has to be compared to the industry norm. For instance^ in the pharma industry^ this ratio is 85 per cent. Many of the Indian pharma companies^ however^ fail in this test. The reasons could be due to debtor days being unusually long. The longer collection period is^ in most instances^ due to most of the invoices being fabricated that results in bloated receivables. This in turn results in fabricated profits and inflated networth^ based on which the companies go and borrow money from banks and mutual funds.These safeguards are useful in normal times too. But during Covid-19^ the pandemic itself can be used as a pretext by many companies to steal investors’ money.Do you think that going for companies audited by the Big Four or the top audit firms can help investors?Everybody is human. I haven’t found any difference between companies audited by the prestigious and not-so prestigious auditors. What is interesting is to see the name of the audit partners on financial statements. Some audit partners keep popping up in several dubious sets of accounts. The same people keep signing on accounts that test the limits of human rationality.Can you give me a brief description of the stocks that you call -- consistent compounders? What are the features of these stocks?The way we have gone about building our portfolio across large-^ mid- and small-caps and the financial sector fund is to look for a) companies with clean accounts^ b) companies that sell essential products^ which the vast population needs to use in their daily lives. Since we are a poor country^ if we take manufacturers of essentials such as dairy products^ pharmaceuticals^ under-garments^ foot-wear etc^ the demand can be far more robust. c) Companies with barriers of entry higher than Mt Everest. d) Companies that are able to generate return on capital between 35 to 50 per cent. We find that such companies are sector monopolists. Because the return on capital employed is high^ such companies are able to generate free cash flows equaling 30 per cent of capital employed every year. Free cash-flow is return on capital minus cost of capital (45% - 15% = 30%). e) Most of these consistent compounders dividend out a third of their free cash flow and re-invest two-third of it^ and they grow the business by 20 per cent per annum. If you grow your capital employed by 20 per cent every year^ on a ten-year period^ your profits will grow anywhere between 20 to 25 per cent every year.These are the criteria we use to pick stocks for all our portfolios – consistent compounders^ little champs (which is currently closed for inflows) and our financial sector fund^ Kings of Capital that consists of clean dominant financial franchises such as HDFC Bank^ Kotak Bank^ HDFC Life.Companies such as Britannia^ Marico^ Pidilite^ Asian Paints and Berger Paints^ Nestle etc are a few that pass all these tests. To put it in cricketing parlance^ these companies not only have a high batting average^ they also have a high strike rate.What do you mean by entry barrier higher than Mt Everest?A book called ‘The Myth of Capitalism’ by American economist Jonathan Tepper describes this well. So^ we have two types of barriers^ the first is around regulation. The ability to get the regulations to be in your favour or tilting it towards you. The second is the ability to use technology and big data in a weaponised manner^ where your competitors can see what you are doing^ but they can not do the same because they don’t have the data or the kind of data scientists that you have on board. Increasingly^ the largest monopolies in our country are marrying these two pillars of monopoly strength.As a results of this^ the top 20 profit generators account for nearly 70 per cent of India’s corporate profits. Twenty years ago^ the top 20 companies accounted for only 15 per cent of corporate profits. This is because adept companies have built high entry barriers^ As long as they don’t get complacent these companies can keep compounding investor wealth.What are your views on timing the market?Practically it is hard to time the market and also this exercise is futile. Let’s take Asian Paints^ over the last 10 years^ if you bought ₹ 100 worth of the stock in January^ your 10-year XIRR will be 26 per cent. Then Marcellus comes and says that they can time the stock. Every year they buy the stock at the year’s low^ the XIRR over 10-years is 27.5 per cent. These are numbers worked out by us. In a company like Asian Paints^ timing does not matter because the underlying earnings compounding is so powerful that you will anyway make good returns.Let’s take the polar opposite of Asian Paints^ where the companies have no entry barrier^ return on capital does not exceed cost of capital and there is no free cash- flow. Most companies in the Indian market fall in this category. In these companies^ volumes grows at an impressive rate. But there is hardly any earnings growth. This is due to low-entry barriers leading to lower pricing power^ leading to lower profits. Airlines and telecom industry are good examples. The underlying business does not allow automatic compounding of returns here.,26,07

He then approached science and technology minister (and^ later^ president) KR Narayanan and managed to secure the go-ahead.Thirty years on^ the company he launched^ Schevaran^ has become a one-stop shop for a diverse range of cleaning and hygiene products — from chemicals to machines and tools — catering to companies in sectors such as healthcare^ hospitality^ food manufacturing and catering^ automobiles^ pharmaceuticals and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG).“It’s heartening that things have changed over these years. There is a clear and marked awareness of the need for cleanliness and hygiene in our society now. And^ of course^ the coronavirus pandemic has pushed the need for 24x7 cleanliness and hygiene to centre stage^” Cherian adds.His company proved to be a pioneer in the country at a time when largebusiness houses did not see an opportunity in the cleaning and hygiene segment. Since the ’90s^ however^ with the boom in the information technology industry^ multinational corporations (MNCs) setting up back-offices in India began to insist on hygiene conditions on a par with the West. For Cherian^ the timing proved to be perfect.Since the outbreak of Covid-19 (declared a pandemic in March this year)^ Schevaran has witnessed a spike of ₹40 crore in its topline; there has been a surge in the sale of its VIROFF® 753 range of products^ consisting of hand sanitisers^ germicidal handwash^ vegetable wash^ dish cleaner and disinfectant cleaner for floors^ toilets and windows. The anti-viral hand sanitiser^ adhering to World Health Organization (WHO) standards^ was developed in 2003 by the company’s senior scientific advisor Richard Joseph.Family-owned Schevaran Laboratories is located in Mysuru^ Karnataka. “We were like a ‘start-up’ in today’s terminology^ but with no finances coming from any recognised sources^” says Cherian. He relied on his own funds and loans from Karnataka State Financial Corporation and Canara Bank. The state government^ too^ supported him ably^ he says. “I was able to get all approvals such as land allotment^ Cauvery water connection^ power connection and all licences in flat four days. This speaks volumes for the industry-friendly atmosphere in the state.”The company’s name is an amalgam of his name and that of his wife Miriam. It also helped that it sounded like one of his favourite brand names. “I always admired Chevron^ the oil major^ and wanted to build a company like that in the cleaning business^ which I knew will be the future of the world^” he says.In the early days^ Schevaran manufactured disinfectants^ multipurpose cleaners and food industry sanitisers. The next big task was to market them.Cherian says that though he met with persistent pushback from one particular MNC with a long presence in the country^ Schevaran managed to bag Wipro as its first large client^ followed by Infosys^ Ford Motors^ and TVS Motor.At a time when the market for hygiene products was still nascent in India^ Schevaran had more trainers than sales people to explain to customers the proper usage of chemicals.“I have visited clients across the country to develop the market^” says Cherian.From 12 initially^ the number of workers at the company now exceeds 100.With over 100 formulations in its kitty^ the company — which boasts the international quality certification ISO 9001:2015 — is a leading player in the country’s estimated ₹1^500-crore cleaning chemicals industry^ which is predominantly in the unorganised sector.Mysuru was a natural choice of location for him as it is home to many premier research institutes^ especially the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) and the Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL)^ which played a vital role in the growth of Schevaran. Citing the support extended by CFTRI directors BL Amla and V Prakash^ Cherian says^ “We could work together and develop very unique formulations for cold storage disinfection.”Schevaran recently tied up with CFTRI to develop environment-friendly and cost-effective sanitisers and disinfectants for rural areas.The Schevaran Innovation Centre was set up in 2014 to develop formulations with eco-friendly and bio-based — natural/ near-natural/ phytochemical — ingredients.Headed by TN Bhavanishankar^ a former director of American spirits company Bacardi^ the innovation centre has on its advisory board several former scientists from CFTRI^ including the former director V Prakash as its chairman^ and Richard Joseph^ KN Gurudutt and MC Varadaraj as senior advisors.The centre brings out a quarterly newsletter^ Schevaran Innovator. One of its major objectives is to keep customers informed through seminars/ symposiums on ways to ensure a clean and hygienic environment at work and home^ proper healthcare^ healthy and hygienic food^ and eco-friendly hygiene products^ Cherian explains.A range of herbal — non-alcoholic — sanitisers is ready for launch and awaiting patent registration.As part of its corporate social responsibility efforts^ the company conducts a programme called ‘Hygiene in Schools’ for the students of Stds IV to VIII in select government schools in Mysuru; it provides the youngsters a kit containing a toothbrush^ toothpaste^ bath soap^ nail cutter and hand soap at regular intervals.It also financially assists children from needy families to continue their education^ provides financial aid for palliative care^ and^ under the ‘Save A Child’ project with the Rotary Club of Mysore West and the city’s Kamakshi Hospital^ it funds dialysis treatment for children born with genetic disorders.In the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic^ the need for mechanisation and automation has assumed importance as it reduces human intervention^ cuts cost^ and is safer.Through a tie-up with Cleanfix AG of Switzerland^ Schevaran is manufacturing and marketing a range of Cleanfix cleaning machines for the Asian market. These machines are used to automate cleaning in industries^ offices^ malls^ hotels^ hospitals^ and airports.The company also has a tie-up with Filmop International of Italy to market its environment-friendly and anti-microbial mopping systems in India.The self-funded company aims at becoming a ₹500-crore entity by 2025.Looking back^ Cherian reflects that had the country embarked early in according priority to cleanliness and hygiene^ the pain brought about by the ongoing pandemic could have been minimised to a large extent.“Hygiene is not a one-time job^ it is a continuous process — in fact^ a way of life^” he says.Thomas Abraham,24,07

Its out of home portfolio^ which constitutes five per cent of its portfolio^ on the other hand^ posted a de-growth of 69 per cent.The integration of GSK-CH’s nutrition business with us was done seamlessly with good performance on both growth and margins^ said HUL.Rural pushThe rural market has been more resilient compared to the urban market^ said Srinivas Phatak^ chief financial officer^ HUL. Rural India constitutes around 40 per cent of HUL’s sales.“While it is too early to pick up a discerning trend^ looking at the past three months that have gone by^ there is certainly a bounce back when it comes to rural growth^ not in absolute terms^ but certainly vis-a-vis the urban growth^” said Mehta.“The negative impact of adverse mix and higher Covid-19 related costs were deftly managed by dialling up savings and unlocking synergies of GSK-CH merger enabling us to sustain healthy EBITDA margins of 25 per cent^” said HUL.The National Company Law Tribunal^ Mumbai Bench^ pursuant to its order dated August 30^ 2018 had approved the Scheme of Arrangement for transfer of the balance of ₹2^187.33 crore standing to the credit of the General Reserves to the Profit and Loss Account. “In accordance with the terms of the scheme^ the board of directors at the meeting approved the distribution by means of a special dividend of ₹ 9.50 per share of face value of ₹1 each resulting in total dividend payout out ₹2^232 crore^” said HUL.The near-term outlook remains difficult to estimate^ the company said. The volatility in input costs and currency will continue^ while liquidity pressures remain elevated^ it said.“There will be a couple of quarters of turbulence^ definitely. And our objective is to navigate this turbulence in the most agile manner^” said Mehta.,22,07
2020-07-20,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/personal-finance/in-volatile-times-dividend-yield-funds-are-more-rewarding/article32132234.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Why dividend yield funds are more rewarding in volatile times like these,The wild swing in the market since the beginning of 2020 has thrown up an interesting winner — dividend yield funds. So far this year^ these funds have managed to contain losses better than the bellwethers — the Nifty 50 TRI (Total Return Index including dividends) and Sensex TRI — as well as the broader markets represented by the Nifty 500 TRI and BSE 500 TRI.Over the past year^ the performance of this category of funds has beaten large-cap funds (known to contain losses better in falling and volatile markets) and even multi-cap funds (which invest in stocks across the breadth of market capitalisation).There are currently five funds^ from UTI^ Aditya Birla Sun Life^ Principal^ ICICI Pru and IDBI^ that invest in domestic stocks with high dividend yield.“We have seen a mini-cycle playing out this calendar year^ with the markets falling 35-40 per cent till late March and then gaining 40 per cent since then. Whenever we see markets going through such a test^ we see classical investing styles^ which include dividend yield^ working out quite well^” says Mrinal Singh ^ Deputy CIO^ Equities^ ICICI Pru AMC.The patternDividend yield funds^ for instance^ did well to contain losses in the 2011 fall as well as during bearish phases in 2018. The category though may tend to underperform in bull markets. The strategy^ thus^ suits investors who prefer lower volatility. “Globally^ pension funds invest in dividend yield strategies because it is a good income-generation route. This makes sense now when there is paucity of fixed income returns globally^” adds Singh.However^ dividend yield-based investing has a downside. One-off events such as special dividends or a sharp fall in the market price may push up the dividend yield for a stock. Investors who bet on individual stocks based on high dividend yield in the latest year alone may thus end up disappointed. Dividend yield funds^ on the other hand^ follow a more robust strategy.Says Swati Kulkarni^ Executive Vice-President and Fund Manager – Equity^ UTI AMC^ “We not only look at the current dividend yield but also the ability of the company to show growth. Even if the dividend payout ratio remains constant^ earnings growth will ensure higher dividends every year. Secondly^ we look at the free cash-flow yield. When a company generates cash flows^ it will have the confidence to distribute it to shareholders. In our dividend yield fund^ we have about 30 per cent of the portfolio in companies where free cash-flow yield is higher than the current dividend yield.”What’s in store?FY20 was a good year for these funds^ with the dividend outgo for Nifty 500 companies moving up about 4 per cent year-on year to ₹1.9-lakh crore^ even as profits dropped 24 per cent. The payout ratio stood at 48 per cent — a big jump from the 35-38 per cent levels seen in the last few years. The tax on dividends in the hands of shareholders from April 1^ 2020^ seems to have driven this trend^ as many companies advanced their dividend declarations.Covid-19 could dim the picture for this year. Already^ banks and insurance companies have been asked not to declare dividends for FY20 to conserve capital; they may continue to retain earnings this fiscal^ too.ICICI Pru AMC’s Singh agrees that companies in the financials space may not be able to pay dividends this year. However^ he finds pockets of opportunities in PSUs which have a stable dividend policy. He expects companies in the consumption space (FMCG) as well as IT players to continue paying dividends.“If earnings decline^ absolute dividends might reduce even assuming the payout ratio remains constant. But if prices also move down when earnings are down^ dividend yield itself may not alter much. That said^ dividend yield is a small portion of the overall returns. Funds choose stocks using this as a first filter. Then the portfolio is constructed based on the potential for capital appreciation as well as the sustenance of dividends^” reasons UTI AMC’s Kulkarni.,20,07

This was aided by an uptick in demand in rural India^ recovery witnessed by the traditional trade channels as well as consumers increasing spending on non-food categories.Prasun Basu^ South Asia Zone President^ Nielsen Global Connect^ said: ""After a significant impact during the lockdown^ the FMCG industry in India has recovered sharply in June and is almost back to pre-Covid levels. This recovery is driven by the traditional trade channel. Also^ net growth in rural demand and non-food categories is a big plus."" However^ compared to other Asian markets such as China^ Indonesia^ the Philippines and Vietnam^ the Indian FMCG industry's growth recovery has been slower.Nielsen assessed the data by factoring in the average monthly FMCG value sales in December-February as a baseline of 100^ and indexed subsequent months with this baseline. So^ while FMCG value sales (indexed to 100) was 101 in March^ in May it fell to 75 but in June it was almost back to pre-Covid levels at 98.During the lockdown phase^ consumers had reduced spending on the cosmetics and beauty categories but in June categories such as deodorants^ hair colour and skin care products witnessed a sharp recovery. Meanwhile^ daily-use item categories such as toothpastes^ shampoos^ hair oils^ washing powders and detergent cakes^ which had witnessed rationalisation in consumer spends in the lockdown phase^ bounced back in June^ Nielsen stated. Rising in-home consumption and cooking at home also ensured that staples such as packaged atta and refined oils continued to see strong demand in June.A Nielsen online survey^ conducted across 22 cities with 1^725 respondents (19-25 June)^ revealed that consumers in urban centres continue to be cautious and prefer home delivery over physical visits to stores. This shopping behaviour is being aided by e-commerce platforms^ online ordering options available with modern trade outlets^ phone or WhatsApp based systems offered by kirana stores and food aggregators’ delivery arms collaborating for department stores and consumer brands. Nearly 62 per cent respondents said they intend to increase online shopping by more than 20 per cent^ the survey stated.‘Vocal for Local’Two in three consumers said they intend to buy more local brands moving forward^ indicating Vocal for Local is a growing sentiment. While 78 per cent respondents perceive a local brand to be one that is manufactured in India^ 50 per cent of the respondents said such a brand creates job opportunities in the country. Around 49 per cent defined a local brand as one that is available across India^ 48 per cent said it’s a brand that is headquartered in India and 43 per cent of the respondents perceived a brand that uses Ayurveda or natural ingredients as a local brand.",18,07

If that was 100 in the index^ then today we are at 98^ which is almost recovered. Good news is that it is a clear recovery but a slowish recovery^ said Basu.The FMCG industry had a sharp decline in April .It started recovering in May (25 per cent decline ) and in June^ it returned almost to pre-Covid-19 level^ said the Nielsen report.Nielsen is comparing the average sales data of December^ January and February and from June. It has dropped March for the baseline comparison as according to Basu^ it was the month when there was panic buying in the segment with lots of pantry uploading.According to Nielsen Global Connect West Market Leader - South Asia Sameer Shukla^ the growth recovery is led by rural and traditional channels.Rural is the major contributor toward that recovery. It’s not that urban has not recovered as it had a higher dip in April and May and then gain. In rural^ the dip was not that significant^ he said.Over baselines of 100 of December^ January and February sales^ rural has now recovered to 109^ while the urban trade is 92^ while the traditional trade has come to 101 as against 78 of the modern trade^ which includes big format retailers.Rural sales contribute to around 37 per cent of the total FMCG sales^ Shukla added.Interestingly^ some segments as beauty have witnessed a sharp recovery in June.With the majority of people confined to their house^ cosmetics and beauty categories were de-prioritised in the lockdown phase - categories like Deodorants^ Hair Colour and Skin Care had witnessed a significant slowdown. These categories witnessed a sharp bounce back in June^ said Nielsen.Hygiene segments including products as toilet soaps^ liquid toilet soaps and floor cleaners continue to be in the priority list of the shopper under the new normals post-Covid-19.These categories continue to command a higher share of wallet in the unlock phase and are firmly entrenched in the ‘new normal’ shopping basket^ it said.Besides^ Nielsen has reported surge in immunity boosting products as chyawanprash and branded honey amid the Covid-19 crisis.Nielsen^ which had conducted a study during June 19 to 25^ involving 1^725 respondents in 22 cities^ found that safety and immunity will remain embedded in consumer behaviour for a long time and a very high proportion of consumers are planning to continue these measures for more than six months.,17,07
2020-07-16,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/fmcg-oil-gas-insurance-tops-fpis-buy-list-in-q1/article32100158.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,FMCG^ oil & gas^ insurance top FPIs’ buy list in Q1,With the initial euphoria over a demand spike for personal hygiene and homecare products slowly fading away^ interest of foreign investors in FMCG companies producing these goods also seems to be waning.According to NSDL data^ foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) made a net investment of ₹15^247 crore in equities of the household & personal products sector during the first quarter of FY21. Although the sector was the highest gainer of FPI investment in the first quarter^ in the second half of the quarter^ it has witnessed an outflow.FPIs made a record net investment of ₹19^069 crore in the sector between April 1-May 15^ compared to a net outflow of ₹2^503 crore in the whole of FY20.While a major portion of this huge inflow was attributed to GlaxoSmithKline’s stake-sale in HUL^ market experts also said that FPI interest in the sector is also on account of the strong distribution network of FMCGs^ the essential nature of the product portfolio and rising demand for personal hygiene and homecare products due to growing awareness among consumers in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.However^ in a possible reversal of the outlook towards the sector^ foreign investors pulled out close to ₹4^000 crore between May 15-June 30.In a recent report on the FMCG sector^ CARE Ratings said the impact of the ongoing pandemic will be sharper^ compared to the earlier large macroeconomic shocks such as demonetisation and GST.The report noted that in Q1 FY21^ April will be the worst-affected month due to multiple challenges faced by the FMCG sector^ such as deterioration in production levels^ distortion in distribution^ shortage of labourers and declining sales.“The demand for certain products from the ‘household and personal care’ category like body shower^ moisturisers^ face wash^ hair gel^ hair oil^ etc. are expected to witness further downturn and may not recover until Q4 FY21^” the rating agency said.Other gainersApart from the FMCG sector^ Oil & Gas and Insurance are the other major gainers of FPI investment in the first quarter with a net inflow of ₹7^195 crore and ₹5^642 crore respectively.“Recently^ BP and RIL announced the start of their new Indian fuels and mobility joint venture where BP paid RIL $1 billion for its stake in the JV which added inflows to the oil & gas segment^” Nirali Shah^ Senior Research Analyst at Samco Securities^ said^ adding^ “In any case^ oil was available at a depressed price^ which made this segment an attractive place to buy distressed assets.”On inflow into the insurance sector^ Shah said^ FPIs lapped up the shares divested by promoters of listed life insurers such as HDFC Life Insurance and SBI Life^ which trimmed their stakes to comply with the regulatory norms of promoter shareholding.“In addition to this^ ICICI Bank too offloaded shares in ICICI Prudential Life to further strengthen its balance sheet. All these instances and more added to the FPI inflow to Indian equities^” she added.Equity losersAmong the top losers in the first quarter^ the software & services sector witnessed a net outflow of ₹4^182 crore followed by utilities (₹4^110 crore) and textiles and apparels (₹1^501 crore) sector.“The outflow in the software sector could be attributed to wide expectations of a reduction in IT spending by companies^ and problems related to H1B visa^” said Ajit Mishra^ VP-Research^ Religare Broking^ adding^ “FPIs preferred other sectors as they provided better return potential given their sharp decline in March.”On outflow from the textile sector^ Mishra said the textile industry was already witnessing slowdown even before the pandemic and growth prospects have now worsened as fewer people are moving out of their homes.,16,07

We are now focussing on driving growth through wholesale and rural channels. We have no plan to drop direct coverage. We have initiated van coverage in rural markets^ introduced loyalty programmes along with advertisements in mass media. We are also investing in digital marketing to connect with our rural consumers.“While wholesale is catering to the urban demand currently^ direct coverage in urban areas seems to be on the recovery path as more and more stores adapt to the new normal^” Mohan Goenka^ Director^ Emami Limited^ told BusinessLine.For a widely- distributed company^ such as Emami^ it is not feasible to have a direct dealership strategy^ with its direct pan-India footprint of 9.5 lakh stores^ which includes the rural market^ he added. “A right mix of direct^ wholesale with a rural coverage will help us overcome the current difficult times. Currently^ rural and wholesale channels are witnessing a double-digit growth^” said Goenka.Anil Talreja^ Partner^ Deloitte India^ said shifting from the traditional way of distributors interacting with consumers to companies doing it directly is a challenge. “I think what companies are now thinking is this--how do we achieve the best of both^ that means^ on one hand^ go directly to the consumer^ and on the other hand^ doing it in the most efficient and economical way^” said Talreja. One way to achieve this would be by adopting digitisation and virtualisation so that the work that would be done physically would be done by machines and the internet^ he said.While a direct distribution strategy would be easier for the big companies to adopt^ it is is not the case for the smaller companies with lesser financial resources^ he said. In this case^ companies will engage with third party service providers to reach out to consumers^ said Talreja. It would also be easier for the smaller companies to reach out to consumers directly in urban areas as the travel cost in rural areas is higher^ he added.There have already been efforts at direct distribution amid the pandemic and the changes it brought about. Dabur^ for instance^ has tied up with online delivery services like Swiggy and Dunzo. Similarly^ Emami has also partnered with Swiggy and Zomato^ apart from also tying up with tertiary delivery models like Delhivery and Jarvis “whenever there has been a significant delivery challenge to retail”..Digital retail ordering systems to connect with retailers pan-India are also being adopted to service retail and SFA-based ordering which its frontline field forces use^ Goenka said.Saugata Gupta^ MD & CEO^ Marico Ltd^ had earlier told BusinessLine that “people with direct distribution or alternate channels of fulfilment are more likely to do well”.“We would like to continue with direct-to-consumer because that gives us direct contact and access to data^ which is very good for consumer engagement. We will look at multiple fulfilment^ and I think the omnichannel is here to stay. A lot of transformation in what I would call the go-to market or the shift to e-commerce — that would have happened in two-three years — will now happen in six months^” he had said in May.Tata Consumer Products Ltd said in a statement in May that it has strengthened its direct distribution model by partnering with food delivery applications such as Domino’s Pizza and Zomato. Similarly^ in April^ it had said that the company’s distributors would list as marketplace sellers on the Flipkart platform. Through this consumers can use the Flipkart platform to buy different combo packs of essential products such as beverages and foods offered by the company.“Through these partnerships^ Tata Consumer Products intends to safeguard people’s health by giving them alternate channels to buy our food and beverage offerings. They can now purchase our products from the safety and comfort of home.“The partnerships leverage complementary strengths to ensure essential products reach the doorsteps of consumers who need them^” said Sunil D’Souza^ MD & CEO^ Tata Consumer Products.“We rolled out the 'Immunity at your Doorstep' programme to reach out directly to consumer households across the country and provide them easy access to our range of immunity-building and hygiene products during the lockdown^” said Mohit Malhotra^ CEO^ Dabur India Ltd.Dabur has also rolled out the ‘Dabur immunity van’ initiative^ whereinspecially designed vans move around residential localities across India^ reaching out to consumers and giving them access to its range of Ayurvedic preventive healthcare products. These vans are currently running in Kanpur^ Varanasi^ Indore^ Bhopal^ Nagpur^ Jabalpur^ Ludhiana^ Bilaspur^ Jaipur and Raipur^ said Malhotra.Kartik Johari^ Vice President^ Nobel Hygiene^ said that the company had experimented with a few models of direct distribution in the initial days of the lockdown when the traditional models were abruptly caught in a limbo. For instance^ it had a partnership with Zoom Car^ wherein 10-15 orders per car was made on a daily basis to ensure direct delivery to customers. But^ now that the traditional channels have also started opening up^ there is a coexistence of both these models^ he said.All companies that BusinessLine spoke to said that there is no plan to cut down on traditional dealerships.The pandemic has proved to us how important it is for an organisation to leverage digital technology to survive and grow^ said Goenka. Emami^ for instance^ is working closely with agencies to develop rural potential mapping^ apart from expansion or consolidation plans being made with the use of maps and digitisation of rural markets. It is also taking steps to automate the modern trade deliveries. The company has plans to fully digitise the entire distribution system for Emami^ he said.,14,07

Construction restarted at our project sites in May^ post the Covid-induced lockdown.The textile division started operations in the first week of May. Capacity utilisation of 50 per cent was achieved which was to fulfil US export orders.The company expects a revival in demand across business from second half of this fiscal. The medium term outlook for Indian paper industry appears to be weak. However^ over the long-term^ the demand for tissue is expected to increase while packaging board products may remain in high demand from the pharma and FMCG sectors.,14,07
2020-07-13,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/agriculture-has-emerged-as-the-bright-spot-in-a-gloomy-economic-scenario/article32059509.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Agriculture has emerged as the bright spot in a gloomy economy,Amidst predictions of dismal^ if not negative^ GDP growth this fiscal^ agriculture seems to have emerged as a silver lining. If agriculture growth^ at 4 per cent for 2019-20 matched that of the economy^ it may well exceed GDP growth this fiscal. Its share in GDP too may rise by a couple of percentage points. In 2018-19 as well as the years preceding it^ agriculture has invariably lagged the rest of the economy^ growing at about 2-2.5 per cent while the rest of the economy was in the 6-8 per cent growth range. Now^ with Covid 19 having thrown industry and services out of gear^ agriculture will work as the primary driver of demand. Other drivers such as trade^ transport and communications have been badly hit by the pandemic; their growth levels^ at 2.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019-20 when effects of the lockdown had barely come into effect^ could take some time to return to trend levels of 7-8 per cent. The same holds true for finance and real estate. In this scenario of vulnerability^ a normal monsoon has come as a saviour. Kharif acreages are up 44 per cent at 580 lakh hectares over last year^ led by a sharp increase in cultivation of pulses^ oilseeds and cereals. Tractor sales went up by 52 per cent in June^ while fertiliser offtake is reported to have doubled over last year. An increase in demand for cement too points to rural optimism. FMCG majors catering to rural markets are reporting high capacity utilisation.A combination of policy steps has begun to show positive effects. Open ended wheat procurement of about 38 million tonnes so far^ the highest in recent years^ provided farmers particularly in Punjab and Haryana with cash to prepare for the next crop. As for the other States^ cash transfers under PM Kisan as well as the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana^ besides higher MGNREGA wages and outlays^ may have helped in preparing for the kharif crop as well as managing the return of migrants. The fact that 63 lakh SHGs can access collateral-free loans up to ₹20 lakh^ against ₹10 lakh earlier^ can make a difference to the lives of millions of women and their households. In this ambience^ it will not be surprising if some of the migrants prefer to stay back and use their urban skills to good effect in the rural economy.However^ these are yet early days. There is the possibility of depressed prices nullifying output gains. The Centre and States should prepare for rolling out price support schemes and improving the working of its crop insurance programme in situations of crop loss^ possibly due to locusts. If rural India is to be the engine of the economy^ it follows that the economic impact of rural distress will be widely and deeply felt.,13,07
2020-07-10,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/pandemic-has-given-golden-opportunity-for-fintech-industry-to-re-invent-itself-clix-capital/article32039315.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Pandemic has given golden opportunity for fintech industry to re-invent itself: Clix Capital,Clix Capital Services Pvt Ltd has a rich pedigree. Formerly known as GE Money Financial Services Pvt Ltd^ its parent^ the GE group^ sold the business to former top executives Pramod Bhasin and Anil Chawla in 2016. Since then^ the company has expanded its reach and now its loan book mainly comprises corporate lending^ healthcare equipment financing and auto lease loans^ and has now expanded to include^ SME financing and consumer finance. In an interview with BusinessLine^ Clix Capital CEO Bhavesh Gupta talks about the future of the lending industry and the challenges ahead. Edited excerpts:What has been the impact of Covid-19 on the lending industry in India?The lending business is very tightly coupled with economic activities in our country. Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown have disrupted the lending industry in India at multiple levels: lack of mobility and economic activity have stalled all-new^ incremental business. Demand is facing a significant slowdown as customers are trying to wrap their minds around the situation and are giving due priority to healthcare and safety over everything else. The recent policy measures announced by the RBI have driven not just the lending industry but also the borrowers into a recalibration mode. To the extent that recalibration has become an agile exercise as opposed to a one-time exercise.What are the changes you foresee in the availability of liquidity^ rates^ etc for NBFCs?The regulatory measures announced by the RBI have ensured that there is significant liquidity in the system today. The key challenge^ however^ that the overall industry faces^ is the significant degree of risk-aversion on the part of banks. Banks have parked large amounts of money in the reverse repo window of the RBI. It is for the same reason that though the policy rates have been reduced^ the rate transmission is not happening. At some point in time^ however^ the measures taken by the regulator will bear fruit. We have already begun to see the needle move in some regard. Liquidity is finding its way^ though in small measures^ to lending institutions and NBFCs which are well-capitalised^ have a diversified pool of assets and are backed by strong management and robust collection processes. One believes that with the passage of time and with a deeper understanding of how Covid-19 is impacting the portfolios and the economy^ the liquidity transmission will only become better. Similarly^ NBFCs that are better positioned will succeed in getting much better rate transmission as compared to smaller NBFCs facing higher perceived risk. Having said that^ it is important to understand that NBFCs play a key role in the revival of the economy^ especially the MSME sector. More efforts have to be made to ensure that liquidity is transmitted with correct pricing to all kinds of NBFCs so that the larger ecosystem can be benefited.Is there a viability concern for the NBFCs?NBFCs^ banks^ HFCs and MFIs constitute the bouquet of entities delivering financial services in the country^ and all play very different roles because each reaches out to a very different set of customers. It is imperative for the entire sector to maintain a coherent approach in doing what needs to be done. The kind of resilience that the sector has consistently shown since the IL&FS crisis^ in terms of managing liquidity^ credit quality and overall business models is indeed noteworthy. That said^ the Covid-19 crisis is truly unique and never-before-heard-of^ and will^ therefore^ push lending institutions to rethink their core business models. Those NBFCs which are able to pivot fast will see very profitable growth at significant scale and those which fail to do so will become redundant in no time.What is the demand scenario from SMEs and retail consumers in the near- to mid-term?Demand is driven differently for SMEs and retail consumers. Demand revival is going to be very sectoral in nature. Demand from discretionary spend related to MSMEs and companies will pick up very slowly whereas that from non-discretionary spend related MSMEs might pick up relatively faster. All of this will also depend on factors like when the lockdown gets lifted^ availability of credit to MSMEs^ etc. I believe^ by the end of Q2 or early Q3^ demand from SMEs should bounce back to a fair bit of normalcy because by then people would have learnt to navigate life around Covid-19. The demand scenario for retail consumers is a sentiment issue. Currently^ demand has hit an all-time low because people are gripped by fear and are struggling to grapple with the reality of the crisis. It is fair to say that retail consumer demand is linked with the optimism of the future^ and will therefore^ take some time to revive. We might see some positive growth in consumer demand during the festival season.Which products will perform well and which areas will witness diminished demand?Lenders will be more inclined towards products that enjoy higher customer equity in the form of collaterals^ mortgage. etc ― eg. home loans and secured SME loans. Further^ lenders might not have confidence from a long-term perspective in the consistency of consumers’ cash flows. This might result in small-ticket loans and small-term loans being created as a new product category. These loans will largely focus on providing immediate financial assistance to customers. On the consumer side^ the discretionary or impulse spend-based products like consumer durable^ apparel loans will take a hit. The personal loans segment will see robust demand. People are now anxious about travelling in public transport^ and hence^ the need for personal vehicle financing may increase. On the MSME side^ while businesses related to travel^ hospitality^ etc will see a downside impact^ others like FMCG^ and Pharma will do well. MSMEs will need significant working capital to kickstart the engine again.How will consumer behaviour change with social distancing becoming a part of the culture?Customers (SME^ retail consumers^ etc) will want lending to be delivered digitally and completely contactless. We must be conscious that a habit that has been inherited over thousands of years will not undergo complete change overnight. That said^ we have leapfrogged digitally by a few years in a matter of just two months. We will see further acceleration in contactless delivery of financial products and lending solutions. Setting up digital collection processes will also be a key focus area for lenders. Even customers who have not been very comfortable in the past with the idea of adopting digital tools are beginning to recognise the benefit of going digital in the new era of physical distancing. The recent announcements from the regulator allowing e-KYC which had been previously disallowed^ NPCI allowing NACH^ etc will further assist in making digital platforms a more convenient means of doing business. Having said that^ there will still be certain products which will need personal engagement with customers^ but that is being tackled by innovative products like video engagement tools that are mitigating the need for physical meetings. At Clix^ we recently launched Maya^ our AI-enabled virtual assistant which allows everything from EMI calculator to loan application and customer support at the click of a button. When the RBI announced EMI moratorium midway through the lockdown^ our employees were able to launch the Clix moratorium journey and tools in record time.How can lending organisations (banks^ NBFCs^ fintechs^ etc) prepare for this change?This is a time for the industry to study and understand how consumer behaviour is changing^ how customers are choosing between spending and saving^ how their income levels are getting impacted^ what kind of things are customers more likely to spend their money on^ etc. The findings of this extensive research will form the bedrock of a new product development strategy. My sense is that we will see a growing need for expanding short-term credit that will include digitally-originated^ digitally-underwritten^ digitally-disbursed and digitally-collected loans. Organisations will have to redefine the way they have been doing business in a number of ways. They will have to give much more flexibility to consumers in view of erratic and unpredictable cash flows^ especially for the SMEs. Instead of having rigid loan terms^ lenders might switch to a ‘pay-as-you-can’ model. Organisations will also witness a culture level change as they will realise the importance of being more agile^ more risk-taking and being more open to new ideas and experimentation. All stakeholders need to heavily invest in tech and digital capabilities. Every product^ every process^ everything that a company does has to be re-thought and re-developed from scratch to be delivered digitally without affecting customer engagement and satisfaction. From application to KYC to fulfilment^ the industry needs to re-imagine everything. The pandemic has given us all a golden opportunity to re-invent ourselves.,10,07

About 20 per cent of the kirana-store owners across metros and non-metros have started leveraging online platforms to get a steady supply of goods and assistance in deliveries.Nearly 56 per cent of the respondents in metro cities said that they have been a positive change in the attitude of consumers post lockdown. Also 79 per cent of respondents in non-metros and 50 per cent in metros said that there are new consumers coming to their store post the lockdown period.“FMCGs^ large retailers and financial services companies should recognise that the kirana store is the new local touchpoint and their conduit into the daily life of a trusting consumer^” EY said.Also^ with consumers now spending more time at home^ there is an increasing demand for specialty food items and DIY items. “Seventy-nine per cent respondents in non-metros and 75 per cent in metros stated that consumers are purchasing specialty food items and DIY items in unprecedented quantities to the extent that the kiranas are finding it hard to source such food items^” the report added.Consumer connectMeanwhile^ consumer loyalty to brands is now in question^ providing a window for new brands to replace old loyalties.

The company is known for brands such as Snickers^ M&M’s^ Twix^ Galaxy^ Doublemint and Orbit.The company said that all its three production facilities in Himachal Pradesh^ Maharashtra and Karnataka are operational with improved capacity utilisation. Kalpesh Parmar^ General Manager^ Mars Wrigley India^ told BusinessLine^“The disruptions in the initial phase of the lockdown was a huge learning. We have been focussing on implementation of safety and hygiene protocols at our factories. The last 7-8 weeks have been much better than the previous period. We have been able to service the demand and not losing out on catering that demand through our production facilities.”He added^ “We have a diverse portfolio in India which suits various consumption occasions starting with a ₹1- Boomer chewing gum or ₹10-Snickers and going up to ₹100-₹150. The larger packs in the bigger cities lend themselves well to the in-home consumption occasion and have come to our help in the Covid-19 times. At the same time^ we are witnessing strong demand in rural regions for lower price points of ₹1 to ₹10.”Out-of-home consumptionImpulse food categories such as chocolates^ confectionery and packaged snacks companies are heavily reliant on out-of-home consumption occasion. However^ the pandemic has hit the out-of-home consumption occasion the most.“Consumption at home has gone up as consumers are spending more time with their families indoors. It has not completely compensated for the out-of-home consumption yet. But consumers have found a new comfort level in packaged foods and trusted brands are benefitting from this. So bigger packs in our product portfolio at ₹100 and ₹150 are doing well. Also^ families which were earlier consuming three-four chocolate packs are now consuming 10-12 chocolate packs^” said Parmar.While the chewing gums category has witnessed a slowdown^ Parmar pointed out that demand in the chewing gum and mints category is visible at lower price points. “We anticipate demand to bounce back earlier in smaller towns and rural regions. Consumers are more comfortable in indulging at the right price points^” he added.The FMCG sector has been banking on the growing relevance of traditional trade channels of kirana stores and local supermarkets for sales growth in the past four months. “At the same time^ futuristic channels like e-commerce have leap-frogged as consumers are becoming more comfortable to order online and we are working on embracing this channel more strategically^” he added.Health^ nutrition segmentPackaged food companies are also swiftly looking to strengthen their play in the health and nutrition space. “There is a lot of focus on home remedies and healthy cooking at home. We are trying to understand the implication of this trend at a global level especially in the emerging markets and will take a call on the company’s response to this trend^” Parmar added.,05,07

The economic pain will prolong even after opening up.Results in Q4 (January-March) FY20 (in listed space excluding Banking^ Financial Services & Insurance (BFSI) and refineries) reveal a de-growth of 5 per cent in revenue and around 30 per cent in both operating profit and bottom line^ the report said.Also read: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/business-disruption-due-to-lockdown-peaked-on-april-12-sbi-ecowrap/article31960028.eceIn particular^ sectors such as automobiles^ including auto ancillaries^ textiles^ steel^ non-ferrous metals^ real estate^ construction^ capital gGoods^ and non-electrical equipment^ among others^ have reported double-digit degrowth across parameters^ it added.The only positive is that sectors such as pharmaceuticals^ IT software^ healthcare^ and gas distribution^ among others^ reported growth in all key parameters during Q4 FY20^ compared to Q4 FY19.As per initial trends in quarterly results^ most sectors had reported negative growth and the department expects the same trend to continue in FY21.“However^ we believe in the current exceptional circumstances^ it is futile to look at profit and loss parameters. What will be more important will be to closely observe the balance sheet strength.“Ideally^ corporates with such strength will be able to navigate through these exceptional times^” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh^ Group Chief Economic Adviser.Balance sheet strength has been assessed based on some key parameters ― debt to equity (DE)^ debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)^ interest service coverage ratio (ISCR)^ and cash and bank balance to debt^ among others.While sectors such as automobile^ FMCG^ and consumer durables though have reported negative growth in all key parameters in Q4 FY20^ the report said^ they have the requisite balance sheet strength to come out of the current situation.However^ there are sectors such as sugar^ steel^ telecom services^ construction^ and realty that do not have the balance sheet strength and may face difficulties in this uncertain period^ the report added.DowngradesAccording to Ecowrap^ the pandemic has resulted in unprecedented rating downgrades across sectors. There were 182 rating upgrades and 2^996 rating downgrades across sectors during Q1 (April-June) FY21^ the report said.“Further^ it is important to understand the current rating downgrades in comparison with the FY14 taper tantrum crisis.“It may be noted that unlike taper tantrum^ almost all sectors face a significant rating downgrade: fertiliser^ textiles^ automobile^ consumer durables^ realty^ construction^ sugar^ and capital goods^ among others^ to name a few^” Ghosh said.Interestingly^ all such sectors have a predominant reflection of consumer demand^ and it is thus imperative that policy makers make an effort to give a meaningful push to demand as we meander through the current crisis^ said Ghosh.“Beyond such^ it will be futile to ask for a strong rebound or even a modicum of a V-shaped recovery as we might envisage^” he said.,03,07

For instance^ the company took just about 24 days to launch the Savlon Surface Disinfectant Spray in the market.And there is more to come. The company is in the process of rolling out soap and bodywash products under the Savlon Hexa Pro brand. In the next few days^ Vivel Neem Oil Bodywash will also hit the retail shelves.Sameer Satpathy^ Chief Executive^ Personal Care Products Business Division^ ITC Ltd^ said: “In the early days of March^ we realised that while everybody is talking about sanitisers^ consumers will also seek other products to disinfect surfaces and spaces. In the normal course of events^ it would have taken over an year to launch new products. But we leveraged on the company’s deep manufacturing and R&D capabilities and talent to compress time and be able to launch these products swiftly.”“More innovations are on the anvil. There are still a lot of consumer problems that need to be solved. We are looking at new areas and working on getting new products to the market. So far^ we have been able to pick consumer insights to not only swiftly execute launches but have also managed to do these launches at scale^” Satpathy said.He added the focus will also be on ramping up the distribution. The products launched include Savlon Hexa Hand Sanitisers^ Savlon Germ Protection Wipes and Savlon Sanitiser Satchet.Local factors at playOn the supply chain management^ Satpathy said: “In some areas^ local level factors in terms of restrictions remain. But overall^ in terms of our supply chain^ we are back to 80-85 per cent of the normal distribution levels for our personal care products across all channels^ including traditional trade and modern trade.”In recent times^ the company has been broadly focusing on Savlon and Savlon Hexa brnads to ramp up its personal care portfolio. But now^ it has begun expanding its personal care brands portfolio too.“We are seeing differential response for different kinds of products. We are witnessing good traction for our herbal Nimyle Herbal floor cleaner. Our newly launched Nimwash Vegetable and Fruit Wash has been getting good traction. Similarly^ Fiama handwashes are doing particularly well. We are also launching bodywashes under the brand Vivel. So^ each of our personal care brands have something in its portfolio that has done very well in this environment^” Satpathy added.,02,07

Gross margins may see some shrinkage. However^ strict control over spends in advertising and sales promotion and a similar control of overhead costs will ensure that operating margins are protected.“We have said that the focus this year will be to protect margins and maintain them at FY20 levels^” he told BusinessLine.Edelweiss Securities in a report has maintained that “but for Covid^ Marico would have delivered low-to-mid single-digit volume growth for Q4 FY20. Company would aim to maintain 20 per cent-plus EBITDA margin in India business.”Raw material prices^ particularly copra^ were flat y-o-y in Q4 FY20^ while that of liquid paraffin and HDPE were down. Rice bran oil was up. Raw material price is expected to remain benign^ except for edible oils.“Demand of coconut has come down and hence copra prices remain benign. Going ahead will aggressively price Parachute^” Edelweiss further said.According to Karve^ sales are already at 90 per cent of “average monthly levels of FY20” (total sales divided by 12)^ which was “encouraging”.Saffola Edible Oils and foods have been growing year-on-year over last year while Parachute^ amongst Marico’s major brands^ has managed to maintain average sales of FY20 for the first two months.Premium hair nourishment and male grooming volumes declined by 19 per cent and 9 per cent^ respectively^ in Q4 FY20. These continue to be weak with lower discretionary spends being expected.Product ramp-upIncidentally^ in the January-March period^ Saffola edible oils saw a 25 per cent growth in volume y-o-y led by “pantry stocking” preceding the lockdown towards the end of the quarter and increased in-home consumption. However^ Marico has for the last one year been working on improving market share; and growth trends were visible Q3 onwards.Calling the trends in Saffola “green shoots”^ Karve said pantry stocking is not an option now. The company will look to boost presence across retail outlets as it anticipates increase in demand. Moreover^ customer retention schemes like focussing on one-litre packs are being worked on^ apart from regular trade promotions.Foods categoryIn the foods category^ the company will be making “innovative launches” over the next three-six months^ skewed towards mass category; but with “better margins”. Foods^ which is now a nearly ₹200-crore vertical for Marico^ saw a 31 per cent growth in value terms in FY20.Similarly^ health and hygiene^ a segment that the company entered into with the launch of hand sanitisers and vegetable washes^ will be ramped-up. “Our entry into the health and hygiene segment has been strategically planned. Since there are too many players^ we are looking at differentiated offerings^” Karve added.,01,07
2020-06-30,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/reviving-demand-tops-ceos-agenda/article31957010.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Reviving demand tops CEOs’ agenda,Getting demand for their goods and services back to earlier levels once Covid abates is a challenge that’s keeping India Inc CEOs (Chief Executive Officers) awake at night^ showed an exclusive survey of 28 major companies across several industries^ conducted by BusinessLine last week.The survey^ conducted between June 21 and 28^ covered 28 leading members of Corporate India with annual revenues totalling ₹19-lakh crore. Also included in the survey were 19 Nifty companies as well as their large unlisted counterparts^ which are key economic drivers.For a broad representation^ we spoke to five energy firms^ three infrastructure players^ four cement and metal firms^ six vehicle and component manufacturers^ four FMCG makers^ three financial services firms^ and three service providers.The biggest constraintOver 70 per cent of the CEOs surveyed said it is the lack of demand that they see as the biggest constraint to resuming full operations — not disrupted supply chains^ difficulty in getting working capital or even worker shortages.Fifty-nine per cent of the companies were operating at 75-100 per cent of their capacity or staff strength^ while nearly 30 per cent admitted to being at less than 50 per cent. Energy^ FMCGs and banking were the sectors that reported high capacity utilisation^ probably as they provide essential services. With operations below par^ two of three CEOs cited the shrinkage in their revenues as the biggest financial pain point today^ more worrying than servicing debt on time^ getting credit or managing costs.The good news though is that most CEOs expect a U-shaped or a V-shaped recovery for the economy from the Covid setback^ with 59 per cent expecting a U-shaped revival and 18.5 per cent voting for a quick V-shaped one. Most CEOs expect this revival to happen by Q4 of FY21 (42 per cent of the votes) or Q1 of FY22 (46 per cent) with very few expecting the crisis to prolong beyond that. However^ none of them believes that it will be business-as-usual post Covid^ with 71 per cent of the leaders preparing for changes in buyer behaviour and the rest bracing for a watershed shift.It was on the question on the level of demand expected post-Covid that CEOs were divided. A fourth of them — from the financial services^ entertainment and energy sectors — expected their demand to register growth. But 22 per cent expected demand to flat-line and nearly 30 per cent thought they would get back to just 90 per cent of the earlier levels. Over one in five firms expected 20-50 per cent cuts in the offtake of their products and services compared to earlier.Focus areasGiven this view^ it isn’t surprising that as many as 43 per cent of the CEOs will focus on drumming up demand through ad-spend and promotions^ while 48 per cent have lined up new product launches. This doesn’t mean that cost-cutting will take a back-seat though.The axe is likely to fall mainly on business travel^ with three out of four leaders saying their switch to video calls will be permanent. Rationalising vendors and supply chains (41 per cent of the respondents) also came high on the cost-cutting list^ suggesting some pain for smaller suppliers.Shrinking the workforce through layoffs is not a top-of-mind choice^ with only about a fifth of the CEOs ticking this box. Pay- cuts for CEOs seemed to be even less popular^ with nearly three-fourths saying they have taken zero cuts so far. Two of them reported taking a 30 per cent cut while one opted to cut pay by half.Half of the CEOs we spoke to expect to restart capital spending in the current fiscal itself. But they hailed from sectors such as two-wheelers^ power and cement^ where players are hoping for quick demand rebound. Another 45 per cent said they expected capital spending to look up the next fiscal^ with only two of them saying they saw no pick-up in sight.Three-fourths of the leaders who responded to a specific question^ thought the Centre hadn’t done enough yet to stimulate the economy^ while the rest said they were satisfied. Many plumped for government capex^ direct cash transfers to citizens and GST rate cuts.(With inputs from Chennai^ Mumbai^ Delhi^ Kolkata^ Hyderabad^ Bengaluru and Ahmedabad bureaus).,30,06

While these brands remain predominantly online first^ they either sell through their own portals or are available across e-tailers such as Amazon^ Flipkart and others.The ₹3^600-crore male grooming market was growing at a double-digit CAGR^ prior to the Covid-induced lockdown.One of the things Marico is doing to stay on course is to invest in start-ups to learn about new business models.“There is an untapped demand there which large players are unable to tap into because that requires high-velocity innovation.

The average return of pharma companies in the BSE 500 was almost 60 per cent in the last three months.Companies in auto and auto ancillary too posted a decent recovery after being beaten down sharply during the correction. M&M and Escorts^ which make farm-related motor vehicles^ have seen better recovery of up to 70-85 per cent. Easing of lockdown restrictions across the globe and signs of recovery brought other cyclical stocks also onto investors’ radar. Stocks of most metal^ mining^ construction^ cement^ capital goods and consumer durable companies recovered up to about 75 per cent from their lows in March.Meanwhile^ stocks in the banking and financial services sector witnessed mixed recovery. Share prices of Muthoot Finance and Manappuram Finance^ which provide loans against gold^ almost doubled in the last three months. Other banking stocks^ both private as well as public have seen a modest recovery.Most IT and FMCG stocks that hadn’t corrected much in March are up by about 30-60 per cent from March levels. The stocks of aviation companies^ SpiceJet and IndiGo^ which lingered around the March lows for a long time^ have seen an uptick by about 50 per cent and 20 per cent^ respectively^ once the flight services resumed. The laggards in the recent recovery were companies in the hospitality^ logistics and multiplex sectors.The worst performers include names such as Shriram City Union^ Chola Financial and Spandana Sphoorty^ which were hammered on concerns over increasing NPAs as the pandemic impacted the repayment capacity of borrowers. Stocks of PVR and Inox Leisure — multiplex operators — fell as they shut the theatres during the lockdown; there is no sign of normalcy returning any time soon.,28,06
2020-06-29,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/rural-to-the-fore-as-cities-continue-to-grapple-with-covid-19/article31938646.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Rural to the fore^ as cities continue to grapple with Covid-19,Amidst all the doom and gloom with the Covid-19 overhang^ rural India promises more than a ray of hope for manufacturers.The first indications came through in auto sales data for April when cars and two-wheelers drew a huge blank with the lockdown in place^ but tractors showed relatively better numbers.Clearly^ rural India is in a better space than its urban counterpart which has its back to the wall battling Covid-19. Be it Chennai^ Mumbai^ Delhi or Kolkata^ cities are in a state of near paralysis.Small wonder then that manufacturers of cars^ two-wheelers^ tractors and fast moving consumer goods (FMCGs)have turned their attention to smaller towns. Agriculture is booming^ thanks to a positive outlook for the monsoon and higher farm incomes fuelling greater spend.“For farmers^ the real currency is their crops. Tractors play a very important role in their life to enhance productivity from land^” says Raman Mittal^ Executive Director^ Sonalika Group.In his view^ the rise in foodgrain production coupled with a favourable monsoon outlook and the Centre’s growing support to agriculture augurs well for tractor demand in rural markets.Mittal also believes that major wheat-growing States such as Punjab^ Haryana^ Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh will contribute significantly to bumper production and better income for farmers. Additionally^ States that grow paddy like UP^ Andhra Pradesh^ Telangana^ West Bengal and Odisha as well as Karnataka & MP are expected to see a rise in demand.Move on to cars and the sentiments are pretty much in line except perhaps for a greater sense of caution. According to Shashank Srivastava^ Executive Director (Marketing & Sales)^ Maruti Suzuki^ these are still very early days.Yet^ he admits that there is no denying that the impact of Covid-19 “looks a little less” in rural geographies when compared to bigger cities. Recovery in the rural markets looks a “tad better” thanks to a bumper rabi harvest while the kharif crop has reported 13 per cent higher sowing.Rural infrastructure“With the Centre’s focus on improving rural infrastructure^ we expect more demand from these areas^” says Srivastava whose company’s rural sales component last fiscal was nearly 40 per cent. “Having said that^ these are early signs and we must observe the markets for a few more months to derive any conclusions^” he cautions.Go further down the mobility ladder to two-wheelers where TVS Motor Company is quite upbeat about growing demand in rural markets for motorcycles and mopeds. In today’s new normal of social distancing and a preference for personal mobility^ the company believes that two-wheelers will play a pivotal role. This evolving pattern^ coupled with a good monsoon forecast^ will lead to “positive sentiments” for two-wheelers in rural India^ says a spokesperson.Beyond the automotive arena^ FMCG makers are as upbeat about prospects beyond the big cities which are still grappling with the growing virus infections. Sunil Kataria^ CEO^ India & SAARC^ Godrej Consumer Products^ says all the good news is coming in from rural demand which is outpacing urban by a “significant margin”.As he explains^ agriculture was “practically unscathed” from the pandemic and this has helped keep rural demand in a “better place”. “Reverse migration from urban is likely to create additional demand in the near future^” he adds.Income gapAccording to Saugata Gupta^ MD & CEO^ Marico^ there will be a huge impact on middle and bottom income following Covid-19. “The urban bottom of the pyramid will be far more impacted than rural. If the harvest is fine^ rural (demand) will be much more in control while urban will be far more impacted.”Ullas Kamath^ Joint Managing Director^ Jyothy Labs^ sees a remarkable turnaround in rural India where demand pre-Covid was “very^ very slow” for almost six quarters in sharp contrast to the bigger cities.Post-Covid^ there has been tremendous migration from urban to rural areas which will lead to more consumption. “So there will be a double positive impact because the number of people who have gone back to rural is much higher than what it was in the past. Consumption will go up to that extent^” says Kamath.In his view^ rural off take will be “really robust” from the second quarter. “The growth engine has to be rural for the remaining three quarters^” he insists.(With inputs from G Balachandar^ S Ronendra Singh and Nandana James),29,06
2020-06-28,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/stock-fundamental-analysis-india/why-vrl-logistics-is-a-good-long-term-bet/article31938610.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Why VRL Logistics is a good long-term bet,India’s road logistics sector — a highly fragmented and unorganised industry — was allowed to carry out operations during the lockdown^ but was severely impacted due to stranded vehicles and for want of migrant labourers^ a key resource for the segment.Resultantly^ the stock price of VRL Logistics (VRLL)^ one of the top transporters in India^ fell by almost 52 per cent in March from its pre-Covid levels. The recovery since then has made the stock gain 20 per cent from the March-low.The steep fall in the stock price presents a good opportunity for investors with a high risk appetite and long-term horizon to accumulate the stock gradually over the coming months. Presence across the country^ diversified customer base catering to various industries and a focus on high-margin segments are key positives that are likely to hold the company in good stead over the long run.At the current market price of ₹166^ the stock is also attractively valued at about 16 times its trailing 12-month earnings^ which is way lower than the average of 30-plus times that it traded over the past three years. Being small-cap (market capitalisation of ₹1^512 crore)^ the stock could see some volatility in the near term.However^ investors with a very long-term horizon can consider the stock for a small portion of their portfolio.But much of the outlook for the company depends on how fast the demand revives and if increased pricing post-lockdown is sustainable or not.Asset-heavy businessVRL Logistics is an asset-heavy business and derives its revenue significantly from goods transport (81 per cent) and bus operations (16 per cent).The company has 4^754 trucks and 337 buses and the business was running at about 100 per cent capacity utilisation before the Covid-19 outbreak.The asset-heavy business model has helped rein in operating costs.The model helps in effectively implementing the spoke-hub model^ enabling it to aggregate and transport smaller parcels from customers at a lower cost to one large hub^ from where the freight to particular destinations is transported together.This facilitates effective utilisation of the trucks and saves input costs.The net profit margin of 4-5 per cent is better than most other listed entities in the space.The company operates across 23 States and four Union Territories ^ and is primarily focussed on southern and western parts of the country.It caters to various industries^ including agri-products^ pharma^ textiles^ machinery^ FMCG^ metals^ garments^ appliances^ plastics^ food products and rubber.In the past five years^ the company’s revenue grew at a compounded annual growth rate of about 5 per cent.The emergence of start-ups in the industry^ intense competition^ and demonetisation and GST implementation impacted the firm’s business in the past few years.However^ VRL Logistics has been trying to reduce inherent risks by adding drivers^ labourers and others to the payroll and by adding new fleet and shifting to bio-fuels to reduce the cost of fuel .For FY20^ the revenue and net profit of the company were about ₹2^128 crore (up 0.5 per cent from FY19) and ₹90 crore (down 2 per cent)^ respectively.While sales remained subdued due to weak economic activity and a few days of lockdown in March 2020^ profitability contracted due to higher fixed costs.Impact of Covid-19VRL hardly generated any revenue during the lockdown period. But it continued incurring fixed expenses such as salaries^ vehicle taxes and compensation to drivers and labourers on the back of its asset-heavy business model. (However^ 90-90 per cent of the landlords waived the rent for April 2020).The business has now started to operate at 50-60 per cent utilisation levels.The lockdown and the resultant restrictive mobility have had a significant impact on the logistics sector. In the near term^ slowdown in domestic consumption and uncertainties in global trade can continue to impact the sector.However^ VRL with its widespread branch and hub network across the country^ is well-placed to revive soon and gain market share.That said^ the company was aggressive in new vehicle addition (around 319 vehicles) in the first quarter of the calendar year 2020^ which led to an increase in debt — to ₹177 crore as on March 31^ 2020^ as against ₹ 128 crore as on March 31^ 2019.This may result in higher interest cost for the company in the near future and can exert pressure on the profitability margins.,28,06

Revenue from operations stood at ₹46^323 crore^ a 2.4 per cent increase over the ₹45^222 crore it reported in the corresponding fiscal (FY19).During the quarter^ the company’s current tax liability was lower at ₹853 crore^ as against ₹1^574 core in Q4 FY19. Tax expense for the quarter includes a credit of ₹340 crore^ it said in a note to its profit and loss accounts.Businesses such as hotels and hospitality were hit due to the pandemic and the lockdown. Similarly^ the non-cigarette FMCG business saw a hit due to stationary and education getting impacted.“Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic^ the FMCG-others segment was on track to register double-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter^ on a comparable basis^” the company said in a statement^ adding that “just as the business environment was showing signs of an incipient recovery in the beginning of the fourth quarter^ the onset of Covid-19 pandemic^ changed the situation”.Segment-wise performanceIn the FMCG-others segment^ the company witnessed a 2.8 per cent decline in revenue from operations for Q4FY20 (January –March)^ YoY to ₹3^184 crore while in the hotels segment revenues for the quarter dipped by 9 per cent to Rs 466 crore^ YoY.The company further added that in the initial stages^ the contagion had a significant impact on the hotels and education and stationery products businesses as it coincided with the peak period and the onset of the school season^ respectively. Demand in the education and stationery products continued to be subdued pending resumption of the educational institutes.“A strong momentum has been witnessed in essential consumer goods and the company has ramped up capacity to service surge in demand across categories^” ITC said in the statement.Meanwhile^ Edelweiss Securities in a report maintained that in Q4 FY20^ the cigarettes segment declined 6.5 per cent YoY^ with an 396bps YoY EBIT margin compression. Cigarette revenues for the quarter stood at ₹5^131 crore (₹5^486 crore). Cigarette volumes have seen a 10 per cent decline YoY^ in January-March period^ the report mentioned.Other major verticals like the Agri business segment saw a 10.2 per cent decline in revenues^ YoY in Q4 FY20; while the Paperboards^ paper & packaging segment declined 5.1 per cent YoY.The board has recommended a dividend of ₹10.15 per share for the year ended March 31.

2020-06-26,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/tall-covid-claims-need-to-be-reined-in/article31926218.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Tall Covid claims need to be reined in,With Covid numbers rising every day^ consumer product and pharma companies are wasting no time in capitalising on the business opportunity arising from the fear engendered by this pandemic. Patanjali Ayurved became mired in controversy this week after announcing the launch of its Ayurvedic ‘clinically controlled^ research^ evidence and trial-based’ medicine for Covid-19. Following its claim that 100 per cent of patients who were administered the medicine recovered within seven days^ the Ministry of Ayush hastily intervened to ask it to refrain from such claims before it could verify them. The Ministry may haul up Patanjali for not keeping it in the loop before launch^ but it is a moot point if it can verify or disprove Patanjali’s claims. After all^ its official notification on April 21 urging ‘serious efforts’ by Ayush organisations to develop Covid drugs admitted that there were no specific provisions for conduct of clinical trials for Ayurveda^ Unani^ Siddha and homeopathy drugs^ under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules. It asked firms undertaking Covid research to seek approvals from scientific bodies and ethics committees^ register with the Clinical Trials Registry and statistically justify their sample size^ without laying down any specific protocol.But it is not just with alternative medicines that regulatory protections to consumers from tall Covid-related claims are quite weak. The DGCI’s fast-track approval to Glenmark’s Fabiflu (Favipiravir) for Covid treatment has also been criticised for not providing any scientific rationale or peer-reviewed research supporting the decision. While pharma majors appear keen to repurpose their older influenza or anti-viral drugs as Covid treatments with expensive price tags^ FMCG majors are not far behind in vesting even their most mundane products with anti-viral properties. Advertisements for leading brands of soaps^ hand-washes and toothpastes today vouch for their virus-killing ability while household cleaners and disinfectants profess to be 99 per cent effective against Covid^ with little evidence backing such claims. Entirely new categories have sprung up^^ from immunity-boosting bread and milk to Covid-resistant mattresses^ in blatant disregard of the NDMA’s March directive making dubious Covid claims a punishable offence.So far^ the Advertising Standards Council of India has been quite proactive in identifying misleading advertisements to force them off air. But this isn’t enough to deter product launches that are prima facie detrimental to consumers. The Covid situation is a good opportunity for the newly anointed Central Consumer Protection Authority set up under the Consumer Protection Act in 2019^ to flex its muscles by taking suo motu cognisance of misleading product launches and claims^ to nip this trend in the bud.,26,06

Revenue from operations stood at ₹2^390 crore^ or a 4 per cent YoY decline (₹2^489 crore).The Kolkata-based company^ in a media release^ maintained that the business environment is facing challenges from weak consumption trends^ “impacted severely” by Covid-19.The lockdown disrupted operations from the last fortnight of March; it virtually came to a standstill until the first fortnight of April. The consumer shift towards essentials impacted the “sale of niche and discretionary items”^ it added.According to Mohan Goenka^ Director^ Emami Ltd^ strict cost control measures saw gross margins and cash profits improve. Gross margins improved by 130 basis points to 67 per cent with cash profits also improving.“FY20 has been one of the most challenging years for the company^” he said.Incidentally^ Emami’s power brands increased their market share in both domestic and international markets. In the domestic business^ Kesh King grew its volume market share by 140 bps at 26.6 per cent; balms grew by 130 bps at 54.9 per cent; BoroPlus grew by 30 bps at 74.1 per cent and Navratna grew by 10 bps at 66.4 per cent.Emami’s international business grew 16 per cent for the full year^ led by countries such as Bangladesh and key brands like 7 Oils in One. The performance in Sri Lanka “is also looking promising”^ it said in the release.On a consolidated basis^ a 17 per cent decline in Q4 revenues led to a drag in its overall revenues for FY20^ which stood at ₹2655 crore^ a nominal 1 per cent YoY decline. Net profit remained at FY19 levels of ₹302 crore (apprx).,26,06
2020-06-26,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/modern-trade-will-have-to-reinvent-its-model-sunil-kataria/article31920975.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Modern trade will have to reinvent its model: Sunil Kataria,There has been a resurgence in kiranas or neighbourhood stores as a part in the post-Covid new normal^ says Sunil Kataria^ CEO^ India and SAARC^ Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL). New buying behaviour has emerged.The home-grown FMCG company is investing to ramp up distribution and is looking to overcome the challenges of manpower shortage at the front end through the adoption of technology. In an interview with BusinessLine^ Kataria talks about the post Covid new normal^ consumer behaviour trends^ and plans for FY21. Excerpts:How do you see the FMCG segment play out in FY21?Right now it is difficult to have a definitive answer. A lot depends on the sentiments and effects of the coronavirus. There could be a stop-start scenario^ where spikes in different area lead to stringent control^ followed by opening up. We might see a stop-start economy as part of the new normal or till a vaccine comes out.Have you observed any emerging consumption pattern?We see a duality in consumption happening. So one phenomenon will be^ people whose income have been hurt/hit will go for downtrading across categories (opting for lower price brands); and^ discretionary spending will be under pressure. The other side^ where incomes have not taken that much of a hit^ will reduce visits to modern retail (as they want to bring down infection risks). Online orders may go up. And we see increased consumption of large or family packs.How are the distribution channels behaving?The biggest visible change: resurgence of the kiranas. This will be there for the year and in future ones^ too. Consumers saw kiranas support them during the lockdown and some facilitated home deliveries; they are now ramping up on technology too.In the new normal^ people would not want to travel long distances to go to hyper-marts^ at least for grocery shopping. Nor would they prefer standing in long queues. Footfalls will be under pressure. So^ modern trade will have to reinvent its model^ especially for hyper market (formats). Big sale days or deal days or this type of models need to be looked at. As a company^ we too will have to think on how we up-sell and upscale.Third is the e-commerce space. The segment did not ramp up on expected lines initially^ but is doing so now. (Some) consumer demand is also shifting online^ where GCPL is ramping up its presence.In the pre-Covid days^ FMCG companies^ including GCPL^ had online specific portfolios. Will there be an intermingling of products?It’s a bit of a myth that e-commerce was for categories that are not available in general stores or modern retail. I think^ different consumer behaviours across online platforms are visible. There are some basic platforms (e-tailers) where consumers go to buy regular brands that are also available at a general store. There are some who look for deals.Then there are vertical players whom consumers visit for specific items; or they visit after reading up on segments. Categories like men-grooming or baby care are some such niches. Take the example of our mosquito repellent racquet. Not all kiranas would have initially stocked it because of the price. So it was launched first on e-commerce and is being now introduced in top general trade outlets.Having said this^ let me point out^ e-commerce for us is seeing traction across all categories.How is the company tackling distribution challenges?We are operating at 80-85 per cent of our production capacities. The situation is improving everyday and at the back end there is no problem. The challenge is in the front end — last-mile distributor sales.One issue is the absence of labour for distributor sales force. The second is: there are many small- and medium-sized retailers whose shop boys have gone back home. So they are facing challenges in opening shops regularly. How fast labour comes back is going to be a determining factor in resuming normalcy.As a company^ we think^ digital is going to play a big role in addressing these challenges. We are experimenting a lot with things like tele-calling^ and are reorganising our route-to-market; remote calling and use of apps to take orders from kiranas.Then^ there is rationalisation of the SKU-mix. The time for calls in the market (by sale people) will be lower as shopkeepers too won’t have time to interact or engage with them at length. So we are working on rationalising the merchandise list.Retail stores saw a “next best alternative” phenomenon where consumers went for alternatives^ rather than wait for availability of their preferred brand. Your comment on this?This phenomenon was happening in April^ when everyone was in a panic mode. Now branded players definitely have a distinct advantage.tweet: abee_law,26,06
2020-06-21,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/innovative-ways-to-reach-the-consumer-along-with-affordability-will-be-important-to-drive-the-demand/article31883937.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,‘Innovative ways to reach the consumer along with affordability will be important to drive the demand’,As the country grapples with the pandemic^ Coca-Cola said its strategic focus on building a long-term presence in India is intact. In an interview^ T Krishnakumar^ President^ Coca-Cola India and South-West Asia^ told BusinessLine that consumers are seeking trusted brands as they go through this difficult period and rural demand has the potential to bounce back faster. Excerpts:Have all the company-owned and franchise-owned plants resumed operations ?Almost all our plants have resumed production under stringent safety protocols prescribed by governments and are in conformity to our global standards. As a responsible beverage company^ we are conscious of our responsibility to cater to the hydration needs of our consumers. At the same time^ we see our people^ as our most important asset and will do everything to keep them safe^ healthy and motivated. Our strategic investment of building long-term presence in India is intact.How has the company been managing distribution and production challenges during the pandemic?We continue to evolve our business models to the changing scenario^ while staying close to our bottling partners^ customers and suppliers. To ensure our products’ availability^ we maintain business continuity plans to look at the entire value chain including supply chain^ distribution and inventory management. Amongst the upper urban consumer^ there is a strong movement towards newer platforms for purchase like e-commerce and an increased interaction with newer products^ while for people in the bottom of the pyramid^ affordable solutions are being sought. Hence^ innovative ways to reach the consumer along with affordability will be important to drive demand. This increases the role that Coca-Cola needs to play in the consumer’s life^ by adapting itself to the changing behaviours towards the ‘new normal’ and using the merits of its agility^ range of product offerings and its core strategy of simplicity and focus on the evolving consumer needs.How are you leveraging on the rising in-home consumption trend?The Indian consumers are going through a myriad set of emotions — elated with the time they are getting to spend with their family but equally^ increasingly anxious and uncertain about their jobs and health. With consumers very positive about the time spent with family^ ‘at home consumption’ continues to be the key occasion for beverages. Drinking occasions of ‘while watching TV’ and ‘accompaniment with a meal’ are strong for the sparkling category. ‘Away from home’ is already showing signs of revival and trending back over the weeks.What are the other key consumption trends that you are witnessing?While consumers are conscious of what they are buying and dependent on what is available^ there is a strong trend to purchase trusted brands. Coca-Cola’s heritage and its relationship with the consumer over the years has helped us continue to be a part of the consumer’s basket even during this pandemic.There is also a changing channel choice witnessed in consumer behaviour. Grocers^ who have been the lifeline during the lockdown^ are likely to continue to be a stronger channel along with the newly emerging chemists who are unaffected by the lockdown.With growing focus on health^ is the company fast-tracking any new launches? Given the business disruption^ are you also re-looking at your overall portfolio?We remain committed to our four strategic pillars of growing the core^ providing local/ hyper-local beverages to our consumers^ developing our Indian brands to go global and creating a platform that interacts with socio-economic engines of India. We have introduced ‘Spiced Buttermilk’^ a refreshing offering under the dairy beverage brand — VIO and this has found increased demand in 2020. Made from curd^ VIO Spiced Buttermilk offers pure goodness of the traditional home-made chhaas with a spicy twist. As the situation evolves^ we will flex our business models to adapt to the new normal to deliver long-term shared value in India.What is your outlook for rural demand?With the reverse migration to rural regions^ better agricultural income and government support^ rural demand can potentially bounce back faster.What is your view on growth forecast for the FMCG sector?What we are hoping and working for is what we have learnt historically^ in our 134 years of history^ we have witnessed it all^ be it health-related^ military conflicts or economic crisis^ we have always come out of that stronger. In the short term^ we witness early signs of recovery in countries where the Covid-19 status is more stable and on the decline. We firmly believe that India^ as a market^ has phenomenal business potential over the long term.,21,06
2020-06-21,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/big-story/big-story-india-incs-battle-against-covid-19s/article31876102.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Big Story | India Inc’s battle against Covid-19,Consumption: Demand is the wild cardThe Covid-19 outbreak has only accelerated the consumption slowdown that has been in place in the past few quarters.For just about 15 days of disruption^ the top-line growth for companies in sectors such as automobiles^ consumer durables and FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) whose March 2020 quarter results have been announced^ dropped by about 20 per cent y-o-y^ driven primarily by weak volumes.Sale of big-ticket consumption items such as automobiles took a knock^ with leading companies such as Maruti Suzuki^ Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company seeing a sharp drop of 16-30 per cent in volumes.Even among small-ticket consumption items^ relatively more discretionary segments such as personal care slowed down while foods did well. For instance^ Hindustan Unilever^ which earns 40-45 per cent of its revenues from personal care products^ saw its overall volumes drop by 7 per cent. Marico was able to contain the volume drop at 3 per cent^ thanks to its ‘Saffola’ edible oil and packaged foods portfolio. Nestle and Britannia are among the frontline FMCG companies that saw a top-line growth^ thanks to their focus on packaged food products.A cooling off in prices of certain inputs helped a few companies^ but lack of operating leverage due to weak sales impacted the margins for many. Many frontline companies such as Dabur^ Godrej Consumer^ Gillette^ Jyothy Laboratories^ Blue Star^ Hawkins Cookers^ Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki saw double-digit falls in profits.OutlookCompanies have restarted production^ although they are not operating at full capacities. FMCG companies are using new delivery modes to directly reach retailers and customers instead of depending primarily on the wholesale channel. Most players have added hygiene products such as hand sanitisers^ disinfectant wipes/sprays and vegetable/fruit wash liquids to their product line in a bid to shore up volumes.For most auto companies^ 80-90 per cent of the dealerships have opened up and the initial footfalls have been encouraging^ going by management commentary. Pay-cuts and job losses may curtail big-ticket spending^ but the need for social distancing may aid personal vehicle sales. Value products such as commuter bikes and compact cars can do better than the rest of the categories.With rural India relatively less affected by Covid-19^ companies with good rural reach^ such as HUL^ Dabur^ Hero MotoCorp^ Maruti^ and Mahindra and Mahindra (for tractors)^ may see better volumes.However^ it is still early days and sustenance of demand remains a wild card.On their part^ companies are cutting costs by rationalising advertising spends^ overheads^ etc^ pruning capital expenditure as well as writing down unsuccessful investments to conserve cash in these difficult times.For instance^ Tata Motors has embarked on a cost-saving programme of ₹1^500 crore for its domestic business and of £1.5 billion for Jaguar Land Rover; M&M has written down its investment worth about ₹2^700 crore in Ssangyong and its US electric bike business; and Hero has cut its capex for this fiscal by ₹400 crore.Banking: Asset-quality concerns weighThe Covid-led lockdown and the slew of RBI measures have impacted the business and earnings of banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). While the immediate impact of the pandemic was visible in the March quarter^ in the notable slowdown in disbursements and collection activity^ the real fallout of the massive disruption in economic activity across sectors and income/job losses will be known only in the coming quarters.The six-month moratorium (until August 31) has added to the uncertainty in asset quality. Hence^ aside from the commentary of the managements on the outlook for the coming year^ disclosures around the quantum of loans under moratorium and the additional Covid-19-related provisions have been under focus.For instance^ while HDFC Bank’s moratorium usage was low (until March)^ the bank made ₹1^550 crore of provisions relating to Covid-19 during the March quarter — this should mitigate the risk of higher defaults owing to its relatively high share of credit cards and personal loans.For Axis Bank^ 25-28 per cent of customers^ in value^ claimed the moratorium (until April 25)^ which is notable. However^ the bank has made large provisions of ₹3^000 crore related to Covid-19. ICICI Bank stated that 30 per cent of its loans are under moratorium (end-April)^ and it has made ₹2^725 crore of provisioning towards Covid-19.SBI disclosed that about 23 per cent of its term loans are under moratorium^ and has made ₹938 crore provisions related to Covid.Overall^ 30-40 percent of all loans are under moratorium currently^ but this number may go up significantly with the RBI’s extension of moratorium by another three months (until August 31). For some banks^ the moratorium portion has been larger owing to their exposure to SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) and MFIs (micro finance institutions) — 98 per cent of Equitas Small Finance Bank’s customers opted for moratorium; 100 per cent of Bandhan Bank’s micro loans were under moratorium (in April) owing to inability to physically make collections. Overall^ the commentary of most banks around growth has been cautious^ as the focus will continue to be on risk management in the near term.On the NBFC front^ some of the stronger and larger players^ with healthy funding bases and collection networks^ may be able to tide over the volatile times better. However^ growth is likely to come under pressure as most managements have reiterated that their near-term focus will be on recoveries and cost efficiencies.For instance^ Bajaj Finance stated that it has taken a cautious stance and tightened underwriting norms.It will also continue to run a high liquidity buffer^ despite the impact on the cost of funds. The company had about 27 per cent of loans under moratorium (as of April-end) and has made a contingency provision of ₹900 crore for Covid.In the case of Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company^ about 76 per cent of its customers have opted for the moratorium.The firm has made a provision of ₹504 crore to deal with Covid-19-related stress.Information Technology: Cost-cutting to the foreWhile Indian information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services companies have weathered the Covid-19 storm well^ especially from an operational perspective^ their financials have not been immune to it.With clients delaying spends and asking for discounts^ cutting costs seems to be on the top of every company’s minds.As a result^ almost all of the top-tier listed IT companies have stopped hirings^ suspended revenue and/or margin guidance^ and even suspended pay hikes. These include Infosys^ Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies.Most companies took a hit to their profits in the March 2020 quarter^ except for HCL Tech^ which reported a 7.7 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit. Tech Mahindra was the worst-hit^ with an impairment provision of ₹218 crore leading to a 30 per cent fall net profit. Except for HCL Tech^ no large-tier company managed to meet their revenue growth guidance.Revenues from the BFSI (banking^ financial services and insurance) segment^ slowed or even turned negative for many IT companies. The fall of the dollar helped cushion margins^ despite a fall in revenues and a spike in costs.OutlookResearch firm Gartner expects IT spending to fall worldwide by 8 per cent. The consensus among most companies is that there will be six months of pain in 2020^ which may extend to the third quarter of FY2020-21.Almost all companies see demand from customers returning to pre-Covid levels towards the end of 2020.Companies are trying to operate nimbly^ with many employees working from home. Some firms have bought a large number of laptops and software packages to enable employees to work seamlessly. This has led to a spike in costs in the quarter ended March 31^ 2020.HCL Tech^ TCS^ Infosys and many other companies expect consumer retail to be hit as a result of the pandemic^ but demand for grocery retailers is expected to remain robust. Financial services companies are expected to go through with their technology spending commitments. Revenues from communication services have been trending well for most IT services companies^ across market-caps.Infrastructure^ Real Estate^ Cement: Capex and investment to take a knockThe construction segment^ which had been already facing a demand slowdown in FY20^ received a heavy blow on revenues in the March quarter. Just a two-week lockdown in March impacted the topline of infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro by about ₹1^800 crore. The lockdown also impacted the toll collections of companies such as Ashoka Buildcon and KNR Constructions.For real-estate players^ the two-month halt in construction activity^ aside from the delay in project deliveries^ also led to postponement of new launches. Sunteck Realty^ for instance^ has postponed the launch of new projects^ such as 4th Avenue second tower (Mumbai)^ to Q3FY21.Similarly^ Embassy REIT’s new property delivery could be delayed by another two quarters.While these delays could lead to further losses on account of penalties^ etc^ the Centre has offered temporary relief to construction contractors (working on governmental orders) and real-estate developers^ for any Covid-19-induced project delays (for six months).Those not covered by this are moving courts to seek relief under force majeure.The top-line numbers of large commercial property developers^ including Prestige Estates Projects^ Phoenix Mills and DLF^ received another blow in the form of a waiver in lease rental payments in their retail segments (malls). DLF estimates that the rent waiver could lead to a quarterly revenue loss of ₹125 crore.Slow recoveryWhile the lockdown restrictions have now been eased in several parts of the country^ resumption in construction activity will take a while due to a host of reasons — reverse migration of labour^ delays in land acquisition and other approvals^ material shortages^ and logistics-related issues. Larsen & Toubro has reported that while about 90 per cent of its construction sites have resumed operations^ only 40 per cent of its workforce is back at the sites as of the first week of June.Companies in the construction space may also witness near-term shortages in working capital — receivables from government departments could be deferred for infrastructure players^ and real-estate developers could witness delayed payments from existing home buyers^ given job losses and pay-cuts across industries. In the office segment^ contract renewals and construction may also be delayed.Also^ for certain infrastructure players^ such as Ashoka Buildcon^ who were eyeing stake sales as a means to cut down their debt^ the lockdown has put such plans on hold.Weak demandWith tight finances in both public (Central and State) and private sectors^ the capex and investment cycle might take time to revive. Following the demand slump in the construction space^ even cement manufacturers are expecting further decline in volumes.In the March quarter gone by^ companies reported 10-16 per cent y-o-y drops in cement sale volumes. While most cement players seem hopeful of a demand recovery in the latter part of FY21^ they fear a dent in cash flows.Oil marketing companies: Slipping^ but recovering graduallyThree factors induced or exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic — demand destruction of oil and petro-products^ crash in oil prices^ and fall in refining margins — have taken a toll on oil companies. The impact was particularly acute in April and May when the pandemic-induced lockdown extended for the entire months^ than in March when the lockdown began in the last week.In April^ demand for petroleum products was down 46 per cent y-o-y for IndianOil and 55 per cent for BPCL. In May^ demand for petroleum products improved compared with April^ but was still down about 39 per cent for IndianOil and 30 per cent for BPCL.In particular^ demand for petrol^ diesel and ATF (aviation turbine fuel) fell sharply during the lockdown period as transport movement crashed^ while that for LPG improved as most of the population were largely indoors.To adjust to lower demand^ both IndianOil and BPCL deferred or cancelled some crude oil cargoes and diverted some cargoes to the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of the government.Refinery operations^ while ongoing during the lockdown^ were sharply curtailed due to fall in demand. IndianOil’s refinery capacity utilisation was just about 39 per cent in April^ which improved to 75-80 per cent in May.Operations at BPCL’s refineries were at about 63 per cent capacity in April^ which gradually rose to 77 per cent by end-May.With a significant fall in revenue^ IndianOil’s borrowings increased substantially to meet its contractual and statutory obligations.BPCL and HPCL^ which have declared their financial results for the March 2020 quarter^ have suffered inventory losses during the period due to the fall in the prices of oil and petro-products. BPCL’s inventory write-down was ₹1^081 crore while HPCL’s was ₹1^003 crore.The oil companies optimised operations and kept the markets supplied during the lockdown. Also^ the situation seems to be improving now^ with the lockdown being gradually eased in most parts of the country in June and demand picking up. IndianOil says that its refinery operations are being ramped up and its borrowings have reduced significantly with increase in sales. Also^ the recent increase in crude oil and petro-product prices and rupee appreciation have^ to some extent^ offset inventory losses and forex losses.Though the lockdown was for only about a week in the March 2020 quarter^ BPCL posted a loss of ₹1^361 crore compared with a profit of ₹3^125 crore in the year-ago period. HPCL posted a profit of ₹27 crore in the March 2020 quarter compared with a profit of ₹2^970 crore in the year-ago period.Despite the recent gradual recovery^ the oil companies will likely take a major hit in the June 2020 quarter^ due to the crash in demand in April and May and lower margins.Pharma: In good healthThe pharma sector has been among the least-impacted sectors in the current meltdown. Year-to-date^ the S&P BSE Healthcare index has gained as much as 21 per cent^ while the Nifty 50 index has plummeted 18 per cent.Despite being classified under the essential services category^ the Indian pharma industry faced shortages in raw material^ and logistics and operational issues during the initial period of the Covid-19 lockdown.According to data released by PharmaTrac^ Indian domestic pharma sales declined 4 per cent in May 2020 (y-o-y). Firms with a acute-drugs-heavy portfolio registered a drop in sales^ including Alkem Laboratories^ GlaxoSmithKline and Alembic Pharmaceuticals.Exports^ too^ were impacted during the initial period of the lockdown due to lack of logistic support at ports and low capacity utilisation at plants. A few companies that export drugs to international markets^ including Dr Reddy’s Laboratories^ reported incrementally higher sales (temporary) in certain markets^ including the US^ Europe and Russia^ due to increased panic-buying.Firms that are engaged in manufacturing of Covid-19-related drugs are expected to benefit in terms of their profitability and cash flows. Countries around the world are resorting to medicines such as chloroquine^ hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)^ azithromycin^ paracetamol and albuterol inhaler^ to help manage Covid-19.Indian companies gain from this as India contributes 70 per cent of the world supply of HCQ. Ipca Laboratories^ Zydus Cadila and Wallace Pharma are the top companies manufacturing HCQ in India.Dexamethasone^ a drug used to treat allergies and pain^ is now emerging as a life-saver (though in initial clinical trials) for patients critically ill with Covid-19. In India^ Zydus Cadila is the leading producer of the drug. Firms including Wockhardt^ Sun Pharmaceutical Industries^ Cipla and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals also manufacture and sell the drug.Meanwhile^ healthcare service providers including private hospitals and diagnostic centres such as Aster DM Healthcare and Metropolis Healthcare have been experiencing loss of business due to a sharp drop in outpatient footfalls^ elective surgeries and international patients.This will impact their revenue significantly in the near term.Metals: Exports to the rescueEven during the Covid-19-induced lockdown^ most metal companies have continued production^ albeit with reduced capacity utilisation^ as shutting down factories would have led to higher technical costs. Also^ most metal businesses were categorised as essential services.Lurking uncertainty and lower demand have led to a fall in metal prices. Despite recent recovery^ on the back of easing up of lockdown restrictions worldwide^ the average prices of non-ferrous metals zinc^ aluminium and copper — are currently lower by about 12 per cent^ 12 per cent and 6.3 per cent^ respectively^ compared with December 2019. Steel prices are also down about 3 per cent.The demand for metals have fallen in the domestic market and^ thus^ metal players have turned towards exports^ despite it being less remunerative than domestic sales.Going ahead^ metal companies are likely to continue depending on exports^ at least in the first half of FY21^ as domestic demand from user industries is unlikely to revive in this period.In the case of steel^ integrated players such as Tata Steel^ JSW Steel^ JSPL and SAIL might see their domestic demand recover quicker than that of their secondary market counterparts which are reeling under liquidity crunch.Further^ the prospects of non-ferrous metal companies such as Hindalco and Vedanta depend on the revival in the demand and prices of metals^ which are interlinked to the health of global economic activities. A silver lining here is that^ raw material prices^ too^ have taken a beating^ lessening the impact on profitability margins to an extent.,21,06
2020-06-19,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/fmcg-firms-witness-q1-hit-but-greenshoots-seen-in-demand/article31871453.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,FMCG firms witness Q1 hit^ but greenshoots seen in demand,FMCG majors across India may see summer sales and Q1 FY21 numbers take a hit as discretionary purchases — such as personal care and beauty items^ and out-of-home consumption — remain slow moving. Some greenshoots^ however^ are visible.Market sources say health & hygiene and food continue to be major demand drivers with new entrants and different product categories coming up. But even then^ recovering nearly over 30 days of sales loss (all of April and staggered recovery in May) is a near-impossible task.Crisil^ in a recent report^ maintained that FMCG revenues are expected to de-grow 2-3 per cent this fiscal. Sales have been derailed^ it maintained. Despite the revenue drop^ operating profitability will be at 18-19 per cent because of “pruned ad spends” and “softer input price”.“Diversification into health and hygiene will not help much when it comes to shoring up Q1 sales. One whole month was lost due to the Covid-induced lockdown. Naturally^ it is difficult to recover this lost month^” Abneesh Roy^ Senior Vice-President^ Institutional Equities^ Edelweiss Securities^ told BusinessLine.Impact on revenueMost FMCG companies are operating at 75-90 per cent levels now. But out-of-home consumption like ice-cream an on-the-go juice packs is badly hit. Some recovery is witnessed across large (or family) packs in juices.Anuj Sethi^ Senior Director^ Crisil Ratings^ in a report^ observed that growth in the food and beverage segment (accounting for 50 per cent of revenue) will mirror the overall sector’s performance. And^ segments such as ice-cream and beverages would see a steeper fall because of revenue loss for the major part of summer.The personal care segment (25 per cent of sector’s revenue)^ which has the highest proportion of discretionary products^ will witness the steepest decline^ while the home care segment ( 20 per cent) will be the least affected because of its high essentials quotient and rising hygiene awareness.Health & hygiene: Long-term play“Health and hygiene consciousness has intensified in the current scenario. People are seeking healthier or immunity boosting alternatives^ leading to an increase in health and hygiene products in an FMCG company’s portfolio^” said a Marico spokesperson.Over the past three months^ offerings such as wipes^ fruits and veggie wash^ disinfectant sprays and air-sprays have been launched by ITC^ HUL and Marico^ among others. Others^ such as Godrej Consumer Products^ are mulling an entry into new categories under home care. In fact^ the hand sanitiser and handwash market has a spurt of entrants such as VLCC^ Emami^ Jyothy Labs and CavinKare.The impact of companies ramping up such offerings needs to be seen on a long-term basis. “Any new category will take time to pick up. And health & hygiene is extremely fragmented with too many players in it^” Edelweiss’ Roy pointed out.‘Nightmare’ quarterEdelweiss^ in a report^ has maintained that amid the pandemic^ “it’s given that Q1 FY21 will be a nightmare quarter for almost all sectors.” Dabur has already quantified the negative impact and HUL^ too^ is likely to take a substantial hit^ it said^ adding that “Q1 FY21 (is) recovering^ but still not fully.”Emami^ in a recent notice to the bourses^ said: “Even before the implementation of the nationwide lockdown^ restrictions on movement by various States affected the supply chain from mid-March.” Operations until the first fortnight of April witnessed significant disruptions^ thereby “affecting the pre-season sale of the company's summer products”.Further^ a decline in consumption was witnessed due to rising unemployment and drop in demand from low-income groups. This led to a consumer shift towards more essential products such as food and groceries^ “affecting the sale of niche and discretionary products”.Dabur’s management^ in an earnings call^ mentioned that there is likely to be an estimated impact of ₹400-450 crore on revenue and ₹60-80 crore on profit after tax in Q1 FY21. However^ it added^ the company is witnessing “huge recovery in May” demand.Marico^ in a stock market notification^ said its business overall experienced gradual improvement from the mid of April to June 5^ and is currently clocking more than 90 per cent of the FY20 average monthly sales. Edible oils and foods (Saffola)^ and coconut oils (Parachute) have shown resilience^ while value-added hair oils picked up from April-end onwards. Personal care categories (premium hair care and male grooming) continue to move slowly.Rural salesMarket sources indicated chances of faster-than-expected recovery in rural sales. Factors such as good monsoon^ MNREGA payments^ how the government stimulus plays out and also faster normalisation from Covid-19 will be key factors.Low unit packs (LUPs) and how well companies adopt go-to market strategies will also determine rural sales.Dabur CEO Mohit Malhotra^ during an investor conference call^ mentioned the high reliance on rural and said the company “was seeing traction coming from sub-stockist network” spread across the country.“Rural will surge ahead of urban. Next one quarter^ I think rural will be moving ahead...While it will be more for staples^ even for a portfolio like toothpaste^ etc^ the impact should definitely be there^” he said.,19,06
2020-06-18,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/fmcg-firm-emami-extends-boroplus-to-health-and-hygiene-segment/article31860667.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,FMCG firm Emami extends BoroPlus to health and hygiene segment,Home-grown FMCG company Emami Ltd is extending BoroPlus^ one of its largest power brands^ to its health and hygiene offerings. This will include products such as hand sanitisers^ soaps and liquid hand washes. The move comes even as the Kolkata-based company tries to de-risk its seasonal portfolio and have “all weather offerings”.The entry into the personal hygiene segment has been fastracked by nearly a year keeping in view the changing consumer habits and rising demand for products in this segment^ in a post Covid-19 scenario.According to Priti A Sureka^ Director^ Emami Ltd^ initial plans were to launch offerings in the first quarter of FY22. This has^ however^ been advanced. Moreover^ considering that BoroPlus as a brand enjoys “strong equity” and a “right-to-play” in the antiseptic cream and moisturiser segments^ its extension into health and hygiene is logical.Apart from this^ the company could explore offerings in home-care segment^ if required.“We are expecting some ₹80-100 crore additional turnover in domestic market with the new products^” she told BusinessLine.BoroPlus is amongst the largest power brands^ after Navratna and Zandu^ with Kesh King^ Fair and Handsome and Mentho Plus being the other ones. It contributes to around 17 per cent of the company’s revenues.Recent launches under the brand include hand sanitiser and aloe vera gel.For Q3 FY20^ the company reported an over 7 per cent increase in standalone net profit to ₹148 crore on a year-on-year basis and a marginal 1 per cent dip in revenue in operations on a year-on-year basis to ₹748 crore.De-risking portfolioMarket sources say Emami has been trying to shore up its product portfolio and reduce dependence on seasonal offerings. It is looking to expand in categories such as hair oils^ pain management^ antiseptic creams^ facewash and so on.The company has already pointed out that even before implementation of the nationwide lockdown (from March 25) “restrictions on movement by various States affected the supply chain from mid-March”.Operations until the first fortnight of April witnessed significant disruptions in the business thereby “affecting the pre-season sale of summer products”.According to Sureka^ “discretionary and personal care products are now slowly witnessing a recovery (in demand). “There is also a strong demand for healthcare products and we are witnessing a steady demand for immunity boosting products. We are ramping up there too^” she said.“Distribution channels are witnessing a recovery faster than what we had expected. Moreover^ rural India and smaller towns are normalising ^” Sureka added.,18,06
2020-06-15,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/godrej-ramping-up-health-and-hygiene-portfolio/article31835368.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Godrej ramping up health and hygiene portfolio,Homegrown FMCG company Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) is ramping up its health and hygiene portfolio with new products such as face masks^ disinfectant sprays^ wipes and others under its “Protekt” brand.From hand sanitisers and hand washes (including a powder to liquid variant and foam-based one)^ Godrej Protekt will be leveraged as a complete home and outdoor health and hygiene brand. New offerings^ under Protekt^ over the last 30 days^ include health soaps^ a new sanitiser range and face masks. Reusable N95 face masks are available on e-commerce sites like Flipkart.According to Sunil Kataria^ CEO – India and SAARC^ several launches in the preventive care category had been planned since the pre-lockdown days. However^ the virus-induced lockdown and supply chain disruption saw some push-back^ in categories.“We have a strong innovation pipeline and a flurry of items in categories such as air care and fresheners^ home care^ insecticides ready. However^ the lockdown happened and now we are seeing a huge change in which consumers and users are approaching hygiene as a category. Their health habits are changing too^” he told BusinessLine during an interview.Interestingly^ Edelweiss in a report mentions prioritisation of health and hygiene will “drive future growth” and the company is targeting 5 per cent of its Q1 revenues from it.Household insecticidesAccording to Kataria^ household insecticides will continue to be one “core area” where the company with “strengthen its position”. GCPL has a host of offerings under brands like Good Knight - mosquito repellant liquids and sprays^ coils and incense sticks^ fabric roll on and patches^ anti-fly surface sprays^ etc — and Hit with offerings in insecticide sprays^ roach gels^ rat kills and stick pads^ among others.Products like liquid vaporizer (mosquito repellent) have been scaled up pan-India^ following good response in southern markets and onset of high mosquito infestation season in northern and eastern regions of the country.Challenges in New NormalThe company is already operating at 80-85 per cent of its capacities (production); and the “situation is improving”. At the backend there are no issues; but the “challenge remains at the front-end”^ specially at the distributor-end. Last mile connectivity at the retailer or kirana-end is still hit.The company^ market sources say^ witnessed steady demand in till the first half of March; however^ there was a complete pause on sales due to disruptions in supply chain because of Covid-19. This led to 15 per cent decline in sales volume^ YoY^ for the final quarter of FY20.Total income stood at ₹5^566 crore in FY20; while net profit stood at ₹1^180 crore.“Digital is going to be big driver with tele-calling and ordering through application being planned as the new route-to-market for general trade and kiranas^” he said.,15,06
2020-06-15,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/covid-positive-india-inc-posts-anaemic-numbers/article31827889.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Covid-positive^ India Inc posts anaemic numbers,The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on corporate earnings in the March 2020 quarter^ though the lockdown was enforced for just a couple of weeks during this period. Based on the results declared so far^ the top-line of listed companies (excluding banks and finance companies) was down by 3.9 per cent in the Q4^ compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous year. The reported profits of the companies have witnessed a contraction of more than 31 per cent.Only 570 listed companies have reported their Q4 numbers^ as on June 12. The delayed reporting is due to the leeway given by SEBI to listed companies^ struggling with the pandemic impact^ to report their numbers by June 30.Lockdown impacts allWith travel and tourism restricted from March^ hospitality and travel industry took a sharp knock. Companies such as Mahindra Holidays and Interglobe Aviation reported more than a 90 per cent decline in profits.Discretionary consumption began taking a backseat from March^ with automobile companies reporting drop in sales. Maruti Suzuki^ for instance^ posted a 15 per cent drop in standalone revenues in this period compared to the previous year. Due to higher raw material costs and sales promotion expenses^ the company’s profits declined 28 per cent. Non-discretionary consumption^ however^ continued in the lockdown period too^ helping FMCG companies navigate this patch much better. While HUL recorded a 10 per cent decline in top-line^ it contained the drop in profits to 3.4 per cent by controlling ad spends.Banks that have declared results so far did not fully register the pandemic impact in the March quarter. Profits of HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank were up 17.7 per cent and 7 per cent^ respectively^ while Axis Bank reported a loss of ₹1^388 crore during the quarter. SBI managed a multifold jump in profits largely due to one-time proceeds from stake sale in SBI Cards and Payments. Most banks have^ however^ made Covid-related provisioning^ anticipating stress due to loan defaults in the coming quarters.Profit growth of IT companies was largely flat^ despite a moderate 8 per cent growth in their aggregate top-line due to higher employee expenses. Companies such as Infosys and Wipro were unable to give annual or quarterly guidance for the coming quarters due to Covid-related uncertainties.Operating margins dropOf the 570 companies^ about 320 manufacturing-based companies saw a drop in operating margins to 13 per cent in Q4 from 15 per cent in December 2019. This was due to lower realisation and spike in employee expenses; up 6 per cent compared to last year. However^ the drop in operating margins was limited to 2 percentage points^ thanks to a 6 per cent dip in raw material costs. The fall in commodity prices in the first quarter would have provided a salve to listed companies. Also^ with the recent crash in crude oil prices^ power and fuel costs also declined by 12 per cent. This provided a fillip to companies that rely heavily on crude as input. Ultratech Cement^ for instance^ saw only a 2 per cent drop in operating profits^ despite a 13 per cent fall in revenues^ thanks to lower power and fuel costs.A 4 per cent spike in the finance costs further dampened the profits. However^ a lower tax outgo^ down 8.4 per cent in the March quarter^ due to the recent cut in corporate taxes^ helped limit the blow.It^ however^ needs to be noted that the trend in earnings can alter going forward^ as many companies are yet to report their numbers for the March 2020 quarter.,15,06
2020-06-15,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/mental-models-formed-during-lockdown-to-drive-consumer-behaviour-says-tata-consumer-products-official/article31814229.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Mental models formed during lockdown to drive consumer behaviour^ says Tata Consumer Products official,As consumers progress beyond the phase of restricted living with the lockdown being eased in many areas^ mental models formed during the lockdown phase are likely to continue to drive consumer behaviour. Though the lockdown has eased^ consumers’ minds could be in lockdown mode for sometime^ says Tata Consumer Products official.What consumers take away from their imposed isolation and the impact on their psyche could well percolate to their consumption behaviour^ tempered by a new appreciation for consuming less.“Spending at malls^ movies^ eating out^ etc will remain curtailed for some time. Though food and fitness will continue to be centre stage^ consciously and sub consciously^ along with health and nutrition will also come a desire for variety in everyday home food^” says Richa Arora^ President^ Packaged Foods^ India^ Tata Consumer Products.The official has noticed a trend during the lockdown. “The desire to limit exposure by avoiding stepping out of home or even taking delivery at home from someone ‘outside’ will continue to drive bigger pack sizes^ bigger shopping baskets^ with limited trips. This also means that discretionary trips and (overall) spending will remain curtailed^ while there will be a greater focus on products for in-home consumption^” Arora told BusinessLine^ speaking on consumer mindsets and how the company fared during the lockdown.On health and nutritionApart from heightened concerns about health and nutrition^ “convenience is also a key consumer trend we are seeing - people wanting to buy and consume products that are convenient and easy to store^” says Arora.The company has seen a run on some of its products. “In the initial weeks there was a surge in demand for both Tata Sampann unpolished dals (lentils) and the organic dals range^ as well as our ready-to-cook range of Nutrimixes such as 6 Grain Khichdi Mix^ Multigrain Chilla Mix etc. Now^ as we move into the phase of ‘unlockdown’^ demand is coming back to normal levels^ though it remains marginally higher for some products^” adds Arora.Immunity & healthPreventive healthcare is gaining more impetus among consumers^ says the official^ with immunity and health high on consumers’ minds.“For Tata Sampann masalas^ which we launched a few years ago^ we had changed the category narrative^ from masalas being just for taste^ to showcasing their therapeutic properties and health benefits. Tata Sampann Haldi has been at the forefront of our efforts^ with the spotlight on Curcumin^ the active ingredient which helps deliver immunity boosting properties of turmeric^” adds Arora.Consumers also appear to be moving away from proactive health minded buying to reactive health management. Covid-19 has altered consumer behaviour^ says the official^ with a sharp uptake in demand for home cooked meals: “traditional Indian foods that are healthy and nutritious. The Tata Sampann brand at its core has always been about the ‘intersection of traditional Indian wisdom and modern science’^ and Tata Salt has been at the forefront of the iodisation programme in India. Both brands in the foods portfolio - Tata Sampann and Tata Salt - are well poised to address the changing consumer landscape.”Time to ACTNoting that the FMCG sector has always been resilient in tough times^ the official maintains it is this quality that will help it bounce back. While the discretionary parts of FMCG may take longer to get back on track^ foods and essentials are already getting on track.“We have to continue to ACT^” Arora points out^ “That’s my shorthand for Agility^ Creativity and Innovation. One of the key learnings to emerge from the Covid phase is that agility and ability to adapt will be more critical than ever before. Creative solutions^ including direct-to-home distribution models and new-age options such as selling through AI Bots/Tele-selling^ will get more prominence bringing in more efficiency in the system.”Technology has been a saviour during this phase. “Consumers have been moving to online and digital solutions as well as contactless channels due to health and hygiene concerns^ as well as the increased convenience this offers. We will see many new models evolve due to changing consumer needs and buying behaviour^” adds Arora.,15,06

2020-06-11,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/rating-downgrades-rise-after-outbreak-of-covid-icra/article31804538.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Rating downgrades rise after outbreak of Covid: ICRA,Rating agency ICRA^ on Thursday^ said the pace of rating downgrades of its rated portfolio has accelerated while the upgrades have nearly dried up in the backdrop of the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) across the globe and in India.The pace of rating downgrades has accelerated^ with the average monthly downgrades increasing by 22 per cent period between March 1 and May 15^compared to the monthly average of FY20.Of the 315 negative rating actions taken by the credit rating agency on the non-financial sector entities during the period^ a majority of them were attributable to the pandemic outbreak.ICRA said nearly half of these negative rating actions have been downgrades (150)^ while a significant proportion has also undergone a change in outlook to negative (122).However^ negative rating actions have so far impacted only 9.6 per cent of the rated portfolio of corporate sector entities.Given the current uncertainties with regards to the pandemic and the evolving situation^ 43 entities were also placed on Ratings Watch.High-risk sectorsThe agency observed that negative rating movements have been more in sectors that were at high risk from the impact of the pandemic. Of the top 10 sectors that witnessed a negative rating action since March^ a large proportion were those that were categorised as ‘high risk’ by ICRA. These included sectors such as aviation^ hotels and restaurants^ retail^ and ports.The agency said this underscores the aspect that these sectors are more vulnerable to business disruptions caused by the pandemic and^ accordingly^ the credit quality of entities is likely to be more impacted than other sectors.On the other hand^ several ‘low risk’ sectors such as FMCG^ sugar^ seeds^ and utilities have not experienced negative rating action during this period^ despite a large portfolio-base (100+ entities)^ highlighting their relative resilience to the pandemic.Shamsher Dewan^ Vice-President-Corporate Ratings^ ICRA^ opined that there has been a need to review the creditworthiness of rated entities^ especially in sectors hard-hit by the pandemic.“With the impact of the pandemic across sectors being multifold^ including slowdown in domestic demand and the global economy^ supply chain disruptions^ foreign exchange rate fluctuations^ and commodity price impact^ among others^ and the general uncertainty with regard to timing of revival^ negative rating actions have increased^ while upgrades have dried up^” he said.ICRA noted that most downgrades have been more prevalent in the lower rating categories^ especially the non-investment grade. Negative rating actions in the investment grade have been mostly related to either being placing the Ratings Watch or change in the outlook to Negative.Additionally^ for many smaller entities^ lack of adequate information (given their relatively weaker information systems and operational constraints faced in data-sharing) has been a challenge in credit assessment during this period^ though these instances have largely been restricted to the entities rated in the non-investment grade.Dewan said that as credit conditions evolve^ ICRA continues to closely monitor the quality of its ratings and would be taking rating actions as warranted to reflect the breadth and the severity of this crisis. The spurt in negative rating actions make managing the trade-off between rating accuracy and rating stability more challenging^ he added.,11,06

2020-06-08,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/covid-lockdown-from-farm-to-fork-supply-chains-adapting-to-new-normal/article31778663.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Covid lockdown: From farm to fork^ supply chains adapting to ‘new normal’,"As soon as the coronavirus lockdown was announced^ people rushed to the nearest grocery stores for pantry preparation. Some overstocked while some came back empty-handed. The unprecedented consumer demand impacted the supply chain forcing each link of the chain to go the extra mile. This changed the journey of products from farm to fork^ perhaps^ adapting to the new normal.Obviously^ there has been an incredible shift in the demand and supply trends before and after the lockdown^ said Aditya Vazirani^ CEO^ of Robinsons Global Logistics Solutions. He explained that the initial uncertainty and fear of extended lockdown had led to people hoarding supplies^ “which in turn led to a shortage^ despite no change in the actual consumption patterns of people^” claimed Vazirani.This increased the demand curve which has had a forlorn effect on the manufacturer and farmers. “This is more commonly known as the bull-whip effect^” Vazirani said.A Nielsen report launched in the last week of March stated that between mid-February to mid-March of this year quantified the exact buyer behavior which Vaziran explained about earlier. The purchase of packaged atta saw a spike of 16 per cent^ spices saw a growth of 21 per cent whereas cooking oil purchases saw a whopping growth of 106 per cent.Consumers behaviourNielsen called this buying behaviour as^ “pantry preparation and quarantined living which included heavy buying of staple food categories namely^ Packaged Wheat flour (Aata) and packaged Pulses. Likewise^ we saw significant growth in indulgence foods categories as well^” Nielsen had said.This led to multiple things happening simultaneously. Firstly^ the shelves were empty for the next consumer. “Secondly^ due to the unavailability of stock and excessive demand^ the retailers start panicking^ and thus puts a bulk order with the FMCG manufacturers. This^ in turn^ creates a load on the farmers^ too^ Vazirani explained.As Vazirani explained^ this overindulgence in buying led to an unprecedented demand for FMCG players too. Hemant Malik^ Divisional Chief Executive^ Foods Division^ ITC Ltd^ said that with people remaining confined to their homes during this pandemic^ “there has been a surge in demand for staples like atta^ salt^ and spices.”Just like atta saw a surge in sales^ other essential items such as milk and other dairy products are widely consumed in India both commercially and domestically The sales for these products too saw a surge.Without quantifying the demand^ Devendra Shah^ Chairman of Parag Milk Foods Ltd said that his company too had seen a surge in milk procurement at all their plants “as smaller milk players were unable to operate in this environment^” he said. Parag Milk Foods sells brands like Gowardhan milk^ Go cheese and Pride of Cows among others.Over 14 per cent of those who had been surveyed by Nielsen said that in March^ they were unable to procure milk and other dairy products.This mismatch^ according to Devendra Chawla^ MD and CEO Spencer’s & nature’s basket^ led to a massive dip in the fill rate of manufacturers across the country. “They were concentrating in the production of top-selling lines only and range production took a back seat.”Among those surveyed^ 8 of 10 retailers had supply and out of stock challenges^ the report stated and over 65 per cent of grocers were sourcing from wholesalers at higher rates due to lack of availability.“Supplier fill rate dropped from 80 per cent to mid-20 per cent. At the onset of the pandemic^ we have seen a large gap between market demand and what manufacturers can fulfill. “Range of components are still missing in manufacturing scheduling^” Chawla said.Vazirani explained that this mismatch disrupted the retailer's usual buying pattern because “he wants to keep all his customers happy^ and thus^ he orders double or three times the amount from the distributor. The distributor has received 2x an order from several shops^ who then further places an order with the manufacturer for that increased order.”This consumer behavior coupled with disrupted supply chains and lack of manpower forced each link in the supply chain including FMCG companies^ logistics partners^ and retailers of these essential items to change their functioning.Working modelWhere ITC Foods that sells Ashirwad Atta ramped up its production across food factories^ Parag Milk Foods altered its production plans. It procured maximum milk from the area itself in order to boost the sales for the farmer in that vicinity.RGL along with other logistics companies have faced the same issues as others in the supply chain^ RGL had to bifurcate teams^ for manpower efficiency. RCL also had to ask its employees to resume albeit on alternate days but deliver more value to the customer.At Parag Milks^ the roles of the staff at the dairy company were also reshuffled as well. “The employees who lived nearby were attending the delivery schedules^ manufacturing units^ and backend staff supported from their respective places^” Shah added. The company in return took care of the food^ stay^ travel^ and safety of the employees at an added cost.All the players BusinessLine spoke to rewrote their safety standards and added their SOPs added temperature checks and PPEs kits^ too. “We are working with our IoT partner in setting alarms through our CCTVs in the warehouse if a distance limit has been breached^” Vazirani said.According to industry players and experts^ the added costs of technology and safety measures will end up creating a bigger hole in the consumer’s pocket. This will cause a ripple effect in a lesser affinity towards brands and reduced discretionary spending.While the timeline to post-Covid is still blurred^ experts also believe it will also take a while before spends come back to the pre-Covid eraMeanwhile^ all these players said that they were experimenting and learning as their ultimate goal was to reach the end customer.To reach the end consumer^ ITC is forging innovative partnerships with various e-commerce platforms as well as new-age home delivery ventures having the capability to serve the last-mile.Parag Milks and ITC have pro-actively reached out to societies and made its vans available for home deliveries. This model has been worked out with the help of our distributors and retailers.ITC also connected with consumers through its own direct to consumer portal as well as the ITC store on wheels which catered to housing complexes across major metros."" malikRGL is considering factors like consolidation of cargo^ automation of processes^ implementing greener alternatives^ and training of employees to manage these new operations etc.^ are some of the factors we will be actively working on^ as part of our new learnings in the post-COVID-19 era.To suit the customer’s fancy^ Chawla said^ Spencer’s & nature’s basket will come up with different immunity booster solutions^ personal protective equipment^ and healthy alternate food categories. “We will also provide a tech-based fashion shopping tour for the consumers to enable them to buy with minimum touches^” he added.",08,06

According to latest data available with depositories^ FPIs made a net investment of ₹19^069 crore in the sector during the first 45 days (between April 1 and May 15) of the current fiscal. This compares with the net outflow of ₹2^503 crore during the full fiscal 2019-20.“Household and personal product stocks have always been considered a defensive bet^ and are preferred by investors^ particularly in a bear/volatile market^” said Ajit Mishra^ VP-Research^ Religare Broking.The household and personal products category falls under the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector that has been relatively less hit by the pandemic^ except for the logistics and supply chain challenges faced during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown. Some of the leading players in this space include Hindustan Unilever (HUL)^ Godrej Consumer Products^ Dabur India^ Nestle^ Marico^ and Britannia^ among others.“Further^ in the Covid-19-led situation^ companies in this category were least impacted by the lockdown. Even going forward^ demand for these products would only increase in comparison to others^ once things began to stabilise^” Mishra added.A strong distribution network^ resilience to make a bounce comeback^ essential nature of the product portfolio and rising demand for personal hygiene and homecare products due to the growing awareness among consumers in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic are some of the factors that are driving FPIs’ optimism towards this sector.“The household and personal care segment (along with food and beverage) are seen as essentials^ and hence^ revenues are expected to be resilient even in the face of the pandemic^” Sunil Tirumalai^ Head of Research^ Emkay Global Financial Services^ said.“Most other sectors (both B2B and B2C) have seen severe impact on sales and profits. The household sector stands out^ and hence^ the stocks have done reasonably well^” he added.The domestic equity market has been marked by volatility ever since the first nationwide lockdown was announced. According to a CARE Ratings study on sectoral movement of indices during Covid^ which measured the performance of indices for 30 trading days pre and post lockdown^ the FMCG index had climbed 14.1 per cent^ compared to the performance of the broader Sensex.The report also said that the sector has been relatively better placed as operations have been allowed throughout^ given the supply of daily household goods being listed as an essential service.Religare Broking’s Mishra said GlaxoSmithKline’s stake-sale in HUL could also have contributed to the spike in FPI investment in the sector.“Last month^ GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) had sold its 5.7 per cent stake in HUL^ which saw healthy buying interest from FPIs. We believe FPIs prefer to invest in a safe category with good growth prospects^ and that could be the reason for a spike in investments in the household & personal products category^” Mishra added.,08,06
2020-06-06,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/how-fmcg-major-marico-is-dealing-with-covid-19/article31764671.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,How FMCG major Marico is dealing with Covid-19,The Covid-19 pandemic followed by the nation-wide lockdown announced by the government resulted in significant disruptions in the business and operations of the company said FMCG major Marico Limited on Friday.The last week of March and the first fortnight of April this year witnessed significant disruptions in the business and operations of the company^ it said in a regulatory filing.The company resumed operations in its edible oils and foods businesses in early April^ as servicing of food and grocery items of daily use were permitted by the government. The hair oils and personal care operations resumed in late April to early May.“With the situation gradually improving^ the month of May saw a near-normal throughput in all the categories except the premium personal care business. The company continues to evaluate the impact of the pandemic as the situation evolves^” it said.Although there have been intermittent challenges on labour availability caused by a mass exodus of migrant labour to their hometown in the past few weeks^ the company is mitigating this risk through an alternate arrangement for sourcing labour as well as augmenting additional capacities^ it said.It has also adopted emerging technologies like video analytics^ artificial intelligence along with the contactless automated screening of all its members to ensure adherence to the physical distancing and safety protocols in factories^ it said.Supply chain“The early disruptions caused in the supply chain are being partially countered as the company has adopted newer and alternate models like directly supply to distributors and large modern trade stores thereby compressing the supply chain time^” it explained.When it comes to distribution^ to improve the reach of food and grocery items of daily use to the consumers^ the company adopted several approaches which included tying up with food-service aggregators and other logistics partners^ launching a direct to consumer portal^ tele-caller facility for direct reach to the top retail outlets and introducing a retailer and consumer-ordering app^ among others.The company has also been focused on a digital transformation journey to enhance consumer engagement^ drive sales through e-commerce and build data analytics capabilities for faster and efficient decision-making across the value chain.The company’s overall business has experienced gradual improvement from the mid of April to till date and is currently clocking more than 90 per cent of the FY20 average monthly sales^ it said.As the company continues business and operations even during the lockdown period^ albeit at a relatively reduced scale^ there has been no significant impact on its liquidity position and hence is in a comfortable place to meet its commitments^ it said. It continues to drive profitable operations and enjoys a comfortable net cash surplus situation^ it added.Marico is watchful about the future as it unfolds and much will depend on the extent of the spread of Covid-19 in India and overseas and how the on-ground environment develops in conjunction with the response of respective Governments^ it noted.“The company expects to witness changes both^ in the business environment as well as consumer sentiments^ but at the same time believes that it is well positioned to come out stronger from this crisis on the back of innovation^ agile execution^ prudent cost management and portfolio of trusted brands^” it said.,06,06

This investment paid off as rural demand continued to grow for Dabur even during the lockdown period^” Malik added.According to Crisil estimates^while FMCG sector revenues are expected to see a de-growth of 2-3 per cent in the current fiscal^ rural India is expected to fare better than urban areas. The rating agency said factors such as higher proportion of essential products consumed^ government doles^ eased restrictions on agriculture activities^ and likelihood of a normal monsoon will contribute to this trend.Early signsMayank Shah^ Senior Category Head at Parle Products^ said companies and categories with strong rural penetration are expected to benefit from the anticipated demand recovery. “We are already seeing early signs of uptick in rural demand and we believe it will be seen even more prominently from July. With reverse migration of labour to villages^ we expect them to continue seeking brands and products that they were consuming while living in cities^” he added.Shah said rural consumers will also seek to maximise value from each rupee spent and higher-penetrated categories such as biscuits fit well in this consumption trend. The brand will leverage its deep penetration in rural regions^ he said.In an earnings call last month^ officials at Marico Ltd said the company will continue to aggressively drive direct rural distribution to tackle disruptions in wholesale channels. In the past one year the company has been expanding its retail reach both directly and indirectly and putting a huge thrust on direct rural distribution.,05,06

The company did not divulge details about the external consultants.However^ the FMCG company said it will continue to invest in its brands and in new product development^ while keeping a sharp focus on preserving liquidity. “We are not just looking at cost reduction but also deferment^ wherever possible. We expect to bring in cost savings to the tune of ₹80-100 crore through this project. Some of the savings would be ploughed back into business expansion. We would also be investing in capacity enhancement to meet the growing demand for our preventive healthcare and hygiene products^” Malik said.In a BSE filing^ the company estimated the pandemic impact of about ₹360 crore on revenue from operations in Q4 FY20.Rural distributionDabur India will continue to ramp up its rural distribution network. “With the lockdown easing now^ we plan to restart the expansion of our rural footprint to cover 60^000 villages by the end of 2020-21. We also achieved out target to increasing our direct coverage to 1.2 million outlets in 2019-20.

2020-06-02,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/fmcg-revenue-to-de-grow-2-3-this-fiscal-contrary-to-previous-estimates-of-8-10/article31731570.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,FMCG revenue to fall 2-3 per cent this fiscal: CRISIL,Revenue of the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector is expected to de-grow 2 to 3 per cent this fiscal^ a drastic change from its estimate of 8-10 per cent growth made before the pandemic struck^ CRISIL Ratings said on Tuesday.While the demand and supply shock induced by the Covid-19 pandemic have derailed sales^ CRISIL said that softer input prices and pruned ad spends will cushion the impact of the sharp revenue drop on operating profitability^ which will still remain healthy at 18-19 per cent (estimated at ~20 per cent in fiscal 2020).That^ along with well-capitalised balance sheets^ the limited need to add capacity^ and the largely negative working capital nature of the business will ensure credit profiles of FMCG companies remain stable in the current fiscal^ the credit rating agency noted.The assessment is based on an analysis of 57 CRISIL-rated FMCG companies that account for ~50 per cent of the sector’s revenues. It assumes staggered relaxation of lockdown from June 2020 onwards^ gradual recovery in sales thereafter^ and normalcy in operations from the second half of the current fiscal.Rural IndiaRural India should fare better than urban areas because of higher proportion of essential products consumed^ government doles^ eased restrictions on agriculture activities^ and likelihood of a normal monsoon^ it said.What also augurs well is that prices of key inputs used in packaging^ as well as sugar^ wheat and palm oil have softened recently on lower demand^ it said. Besides^ selling and ad spends are likely to be kept under check^ with lower discounts and innovative use of cost effective digital advertising. Firms are also focusing on streamlining operations and distribution channels to rein in costs^ it noted.Hence^ despite a sharp decline in revenues^ operating profitability for the sample set is still expected to remain healthy at 18-19 per cent in fiscal 2021 with marginal moderation of 70-100 bps^ said CRISIL.FMCG sectorThe sector has been one of the most resilient among consumer-oriented sectors in terms of credit quality^ found CRISIL. “Despite declining revenues^ credit profiles of large FMCG companies are likely to remain stable^ supported by well-capitalised balance sheets and healthy^ liquid surplus. Small firms with lower liquid surplus may resort to higher dependence on external funds to manage additional working capital requirements arising out of the crisis^ and their credit metrics are expected to moderate^” said Gautam Shahi^ Director^ CRISIL Ratings.Revenue impactThe impact on revenue will vary across FMCG product segments. The proportion of essential products in a segment (foods and beverages^ personal care and home care)^ downtrading^ and supply disruptions will determine the extent of decline in revenue^ said CRISIL.“Growth in the food and beverage segment (accounting for ~50 per cent of revenue) will mirror the overall sector’s performance^” said Anuj Sethi^ Senior Director^ CRISIL Ratings.Some segments such as ice cream and beverages would see a steeper fall because of revenue loss for the major part of summer^ said Sethi.“The personal care segment (~25% of sector’s revenue)^ which has the highest proportion of discretionary products^ will witness the steepest decline^ while the home care segment (~20% of sector’s revenue) will be the least-affected because of its high essentials quotient^ and rising hygiene awareness^” he added.,02,06
2020-05-30,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/aarati-krishnan/how-will-consumption-shape-up-post-covid/article31704477.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,How will consumption shape up post Covid?,Now that there’s a fair bit of agreement that India’s GDP will shrink this fiscal^ the debate has switched to the shape of the subsequent recovery. Will the recovery be V-shaped or will it be a U-shaped bathtub with slippery sides^ to quote former IMF economist Simon Johnson?This will depend overwhelmingly on just one thing — how soon the Indian consumer can be expected to loosen her purse strings. Private consumption^ pitching in with 57 per cent of India’s GDP^ has also been its most hardy component^ rebounding quickly after shocks such as the global financial crisis and demonetisation. But the Covid crisis is materially different from previous crises owing to its twin assault on consumer sentiment^ inflicting not just income losses^ but also the primal fear of whether one will survive.Job and income prospectsWhile the dearth of official employment data makes it hard to quantify how Covid has impacted income prospects^ CMIE has shared some alarming statistics on the unemployment situation. After surveying a sample of 43^600 households in its Consumer Pyramids Household Survey^ it estimated that total employment numbers in India dropped by about 122 million in April after the lockdown on a base of about 404 million.The composition of jobs lost suggests that self-employed folks have borne the brunt of job losses^ while the salaried were less affected. CMIE estimates that 71 per cent of the 128 million small traders/daily wagers and 26 per cent of the 68 million entrepreneurs lost jobs in April^ while 23 per cent of the 86 million salaried folks dropped out.While a good proportion of the job losses in the self-employed category may be temporary (trade will resume as the lockdown is eased)^ there’s no doubt that the pandemic has forced some folks out of employment for good^ even as it has reduced pay for the salaried. This suggests that overall consumption pie is likely to shrink post-Covid.If income prospects decide the consumer’s ability get back to her usual spending habits^ sentiment will decide her willingness to do so. On this count^ Deloitte’s ‘State of the Consumer Tracker’ suggests that the pandemic has battered Indian consumer sentiment far more than elsewhere in the world. In the latest instalment of its survey on May 16^ Indians topped Deloitte’s Global Anxiety Index^ with 33 per cent of them saying they felt more anxious than the previous week. Anxiety levels in other nations^ some far worse-hit by Covid^ were significantly lower at a negative 33 per cent to plus 17 per cent.India also had a high proportion of consumers who worried about making upcoming payments (46 per cent)^ losing jobs (53 per cent) and were putting off large purchases (63 per cent). Strangely^ consumers in the US^ which has reported six-figure Covid fatalities^ are more sanguine^ with only 27 per cent worrying about payments^ 37 per cent about job losses and 43 per cent deferring big purchases.Shape of the revivalThis offers two pointers on the shape of the consumption revival in India.One^ even if the unemployment situation improves with easing of the lockdown^ consumers will be looking for evidence that the Covid menace is behind them^ before loosening their purse strings. Here^ Deloitte numbers on Japan are eye-opening. Japan’s Anxiety Index^ which was neck-and-neck with India in mid-April at 39 per cent^ had slumped to minus 5 per cent by May 16^ as new cases dwindled and the country lifted emergency measures. This makes the timeline of the revival hard to predict.Two^ with less of a blow to sentiment^ consumers in Bharat may be quicker to recover than those from urban India. Virus hotspots are presently clustered in the metros^ with little impact on the hinterland. Agricultural incomes are somewhat insulated from demand pressures^ especially after a good monsoon and rabi harvest. Most of the Centre’s direct stimulus measures also target rural rather than urban India (Doubling of MGNREGA outlays^ PM-Kisan payouts).While rural sentiment may make a quick comeback^ incomes are unlikely to. The drying up of repatriated incomes from cities and more folks competing for low-paying farm jobs will likely rein in spending.Right^ if we have to brace for a U-shaped recovery with more Scrooge-ish consumers^ what are the likely changes in spending behaviour? Here are a few^ based mainly on anecdotal evidence:Health^ hygiene and nutritionWith consumers confined to their homes and worried about their future^ the basics such as nutrition^ health and hygiene products are taking priority over more discretionary buys^ and this trend may last post-Covid. FMCG companies from Hindustan Unilever to Dabur have^ in their recent quarterly commentaries^ highlighted resilient sales of food and home-care products while indulgences such as ice creams and grooming products have taken a knock. While a 3-6x surge in categories such as hand sanitizers since March is no surprise^ an interesting corollary is the jump in the offtake of perceived wellness and immunity-boosting products such as Chyawanprash and honey^ malted drinks such as Horlicks and Boost^ oats and nutritional supplements. The shift from eating out to home cooking seems to have sparked demand for ready-to-cook packaged meals^ kitchen staples and sauces. With FMCG-makers rolling out new products in these segments^ they clearly expect the shift to last beyond Covid.Making room for these spends may entail cutbacks elsewhere. Deloitte studies say that since April^ India have consistently featured a high proportion of consumers looking to increase spends on non-discretionary items such as groceries^ household goods^ healthcare while slashing them on travel^ restaurants^ home décor^ apparel and alcohol.As Covid recedes^ bruised consumer sentiment may mend enough to permit smaller indulgences such as ordering in^ visiting salons^ buying grooming products or restocking lingerie (thanks to the ‘lipstick effect’ — lipstick sales are said to go up after economic shocks because women want to treat themselves). But big-ticket purchases of consumer durables^ automobiles or homes may take much longer to come back^ not just due to the consumers’ frugal mood^ but also debt aversion. Where consumers perceive an urgent need to make a big purchase for safety considerations^ such as personal transport^ they may downtrade to limit outlays — opting for two-wheelers instead of cars or hatchbacks instead of SUVs. They may also prefer to reuse and refurbish^ gravitating towards refurbishing their vehicles and homes or buying pre-owned cars and electronics.Homebody economyAs Covid was wreaking havoc in China^ market researcher Nielsen noted the emerging ‘homebody economy’ where more folks preferred to shop^ study^ work and entertain themselves at home. This resulted in a surge for health products (air purifiers^ fitness bands) and home entertainment (home theatres^ gaming equipment)^ even as folks were more than willing to upgrade to 5G phones and bigger data plans.April data on Internet usage in India certainly indicates that Internet bills have proved a notable exception to ongoing spending cuts^ with Airtel noting strong demand for new broadband connections. Home Internet^ mobile phones^ entertainment and cable TV are also among the few discretionary items in the Deloitte study^ where Indians have vowed to increase spends despite Covid.It is also clear that the ‘couch potato’ lifestyle has appealed to many Indians^ which will render them willing to shop online even for unconventional categories such as alcohol^ footwear and electronics.In the US^ a version of Nielsen’s homebody economy is leading to a surge in sales of eclectic kitchen appliances^ from electric pasta-makers to bread and soda-makers. In India^ this may augur well for sales of pressure cookers^ cookware^ roti-makers^ wet grinders^ microwaves etc^ apart from home-cleaning equipment.Overall^ the shape of India’s consumption revival will depend not just on how quickly consumers regain their mojo^ but also on how nimbly consumer firms adapt to these behavioural shifts.,30,05
2020-05-29,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/msde-to-drive-skilling-in-healthcare-logistics-e-commerce-mahendra-nath-pandey/article31703546.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,MSDE to drive skilling in healthcare^ logistics^ e-commerce: Mahendra Nath Pandey,With significant number of skilled and semi-skilled labourers going back home^ Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is in talks with local administration for deploying unskilled labourers locally. For the skilled workforce^ the Ministry proposes to re-skill them and connect them to relevant industries over the next few months. In an interview with BusinessLine Mahendra Nath Pandey^ Minister for MSDE said that sectors such as pharmaceuticals^ FMCG^ healthcare^ logistics and e-commerce will see a significant growth in skilling. Excerpts:Will focus be on imparting skills in rural India now^ as most of the workers^ especially migrant workers^ are looking for jobs locally?Many workers^ especially the skilled and experienced labour^ are looking for work closer to their homes. We are aware of this and are keeping a close eye on the changing dynamics in this time of reverse migration. We have started working with some partner organisations on mapping out the best way to deploy our training resources and re-connect them to employment opportunities near their native places.We are also talking to local administration to take their help with deploying unskilled labour locally while the skilled workforce will be re-skilled and connected to relevant industries over the next few months. This will help migrant workers earn a livelihood and may immediately provide industries the much-needed workforce to kick-start operations. Once this is done^ then we will provide recognition of prior learning (RPL) certificates.What new skill sets will be in demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic?Sectors such as pharmaceuticals^ FMCG^ healthcare^ logistics and e-commerce will see a significant growth in skilling.In addition to this^ our focus would be on new-age skills like Artificial Intelligence^ cloud computing^ machine learning and the Internet of things (IoT). These will become increasingly important in the post-Coronavirus world and be highly in demand.Technology has also helped in removing barriers including geographical and socio-economic barriers while making job roles increasingly specialised.How the schemes that the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has introduced in the past are helping people in this time of crisis?Under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)^ we have extended our support to the healthcare sector with 1.75 lakh trained professionals who assisted in containing the further spread of the infection.In addition to this^ in the life science sector^ we have been able to support with skilled youth who are helping with the mass manufacture of life saving drugs needed to fight Covid-19.We also have a database of close to 1^000 skilled plumbers who volunteered to support plumbing requirements near their area during this pandemic^ following all norms of social distancing and other necessary precautions.How will training be provided in the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in future? Will there be any changes in the way they function?Although much of the training operations are on hold currently in order to comply with the ongoing lockdown^ we have been functioning remotely as much as possible to ensure all operations resume successfully once the lockdown ends. Due to the practical nature of vocational courses^ the conventional brick and mortar model of training may need to evolve. Training providers may need to embed online components into existing training programmes.The Ministry has made available extensive online digital learning resources through the Directorate General of Training (DGT).Additionally^ we are also evaluating if the 2^700 government run ITIs and 300 Government run polytechnics can start medium duration training programmes outside college timings on Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode in skills where there is demand and supply gap.This will eventually lead to high quality skill training over the next few years. Programme for training of trainers shall be taken up at a massive scale^ so that they can respond to the changes and are available in adequate numbers for new needs.What is the way forward for the Ministry of Skill development and Entrepreneurship?Even sectors not directly involved with the Covid-19 but support the essential services like the agriculture sector is now benefitting from the new age skills we have been imparting. Sectors like home services and e-commerce have been vital.We expect that in the post-Covid era^ people will prefer to call professionals to their home rather than go to public places to get certain services.These home services will grow exponentially and provide more opportunities for the youth.Our skill councils in sectors such as beauty and wellness^ domestic workers^ electronics^ and food industry capacity and skill initiative^ and construction are working on revised guidelines post pandemic to ensure a safe working environment and quality delivery of services.,29,05
2020-05-28,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/we-see-massive-shifts-in-shopping-behaviour-product-distribution-in-6-months-marico/article31692741.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,We see massive shifts in shopping behaviour^ product distribution in 6 months: Marico,The FMCG sector was already grappling with the economic slowdown when the pandemic struck. While its volume growth has dipped^ the sector is less impacted than other beleaguered industries because of the inherent need for essential goods. In an interview with BusinessLine^ Saugata Gupta^ MD & CEO^ Marico Ltd^ spoke about how the company is faring amid the pandemic^ its strategy^ changing consumer habits and shopping behaviour. Excerpts:What are the changes you are seeing due to the Covid-19 situation?I think compared to other industries^ our sector (FMCG) is significantly less impacted. There would be a squeeze in the disposable income at the bottom of the pyramid of the middle class. You also see a shift towards health and hygiene^ immunity and well-being. As people are going out less^ there would be a little less (focus on) grooming. The other would be the shopping behaviour — people are going to use more e-commerce^ the neighbourhood kiranas and home delivery. So^ the omnichannel will grow. There will be fewer footfalls in modern trade because of social distancing. Another reason is people are not going to travel long distances to shop. You have to adapt to those changes.There will be a huge impact in the middle income and the bottom income groups. Whether the migration will get reversed^ we don't know. The urban bottom of the pyramid will be far more impacted than rural^ maybe. If the harvest is fine^ I think the rural (demand) will be much more in control.Marico has experimented with new forms of distribution and delivery. Do you think it’s a long-term thing^ where you yourself connect to the consumer directly?People with direct distribution or alternate channels of fulfilment are more likely to do well. People are looking at^ first^ availability^ second^ trusted brands. And third^ as things normalise^ people are going to look for value^ because right now^ they are doing pantry loading and buying large packs^ but as it normalises^ they are going to look for value. So^ I would say that amongst all the experiments we are doing in distribution^ some will obviously get scaled up and will become the new normal. We would like to continue with direct-to-consumer because that gives us direct contact and access to data^ which is very good for consumer engagement.We will look at multiple fulfilment^ and I think the omnichannel is here to stay. A lot of transformation in what I would call the go-to market or the shift to e-commerce — what would have happened in two-three years — will now happen in six months.Earlier^ you would have seen a lot of promoters in a supermarket. They used to give samples and detail out products. Now^ with social distancing^ that will go out. For example^ the entire way personal care or beauty is sold will change. In beauty outlets^ there used to be these beauty advisors who would help you buy a product. All that will now go because of social distancing and will move to online maybe. I think^ in shopping behaviour and distribution^ things that would have taken three-four years to change^ will happen in the next six months.How are you operating your factories with all the restrictions in place?We are hand-to-mouth and are operating with zero inventory of products. We are rejigging some of the supply and factory lines so that it can accommodate social distancing without a significant loss in productivity.Are you looking at a rejig in the product portfolio?Last year^ we were focussing on male grooming^ skincare and some of the premium part of our hair nourishment and skincare. Although^ in the long term^ we will stay invested (in these categories)^ we will lie low on it for the next 12 months . I believe discretionary purchases will get impacted and^ therefore^ we are diverting some of our spending towards health and hygiene and food.How is Marico preparing for this change?Fortunately for us^ the e-commerce contribution is already 5 per cent. We were having a digital transformation journey in the organisation^ with respect to consumer engagement^ performance marketing and analytics. We are going to accelerate that entire area. Second thing is^ we are re-imagining the entire go-to market in terms of agility^ demand sensing and ensuring that the product is available to the consumer.So^ some of the experiments which we are doing will get scaled up...the entire automation^ digital and new way of work will get scaled up...Then there is the return of the neighbourhood kirana. I think everybody was almost sounding the death knell for the kirana^ saying modern trade will gobble it up. I think these small format^ open format stores have made a great comeback during Covid-19 times. They have been able to really service the consumers. Therefore^ I think that is one reverse change that is going to happen in the next one year.There is a view that there is a lot of pent up demand and that we will have a V-shaped growth. Do you agree?Basically^ given India's per capita income and all^ there could be a pent up demand at the top end^ but I don't see there will be a pent up demand translating into a V-shaped recovery because people are far more careful in the middle class and in the bottom end. I don't see the kind of revenge buying that has happened in China happening here.Do you think the measures announced by the government so far would be enough to trigger demand?Some of the measures will give liquidity^ but some of the measures will take medium-term to long-term to pan out. For example^ the decision on MNREGA is going to give cash directly to consumers^ which will improve liquidity. But will it improve sentiment for spending? I'm not sure. Whatever the government has done^ they have tried to do their best based on the current situation. Maybe a little more to spur direct consumption would have helped.Marico has been investing in start-ups lately. Will you be continuing with that?We will continue^ but maybe the portfolio could be different. Even if we do^ we will look at categories which we believe are more tuned into the current situation.Do you think the pandemic will come in the way of Marico’s target of becoming a ₹10^000-crore company by 2020-21?Yes^ obviously. It’s too early to talk about it^ but this year^ it will definitely take a toll on growth.How are you looking at the branding and advertising aspect of the business?There would be at least a 150 basis point reduction in advertising and promotional spends this year.When do you see the demand coming back to the pre-Covid level?It depends on the vaccine. Otherwise^ this will be a new normal that we will have to live with. A lockdown is a much more easy decision^ getting out of the lockdown is a lot more tougher.,28,05

Consolidated revenue from operations for the fourth quarter declined 12.3 per cent to ₹1^865 crore.For the full year 2019-20^ net profit stood at ₹1^445 crore^ which was almost flat^ compared to ₹1^442 crore in the previous fiscal. Revenue from operations stood at ₹8^704 crore^ up 2 per cent.The company's board recommended a final dividend of 160 per cent. “Continuing with our dividend payout policy^ the board has proposed a dividend of ₹1.60 per share^ aggregating to ₹282.74 crore^” said Dabur India Chairman Amit Burman.“The 2019-20 net profit was impacted by a one-time impairment in value of investments to the tune of ₹100 crore. Excluding this impairment^ the net profit for the year marked a 5.8 per cent growth year-on-year^” said the company.“Dabur opened the fourth quarter on a positive note^ successfully tapping the growth opportunities. However^ the Covid outbreak in March^ followed by the nationwide lockdown^ caused severe disruptions in our business and brought sales to a virtual standstill in the second fortnight of March 2020^” said Mohit Malhotra^ CEO^ Dabur India.He said with most of the products across the healthcare^ home and personal care portfolio falling in the non-essential category^ “the pre-season sales of summer-skewed products to meet the seasonal demand was severely impacted.”“As the lockdown restrictions eased gradually^ Dabur has been at the forefront on delivering authentic Ayurvedic solutions to meet the emerging healthcare needs of consumers. Demand patterns have changed significantly^ with consumers increasingly seeking Ayurveda-based interventions for boosting their immunity^ besides products that meet their personal and household hygiene needs^” Malhotra said.The company said it has witnessed a 400 per cent surge in demand for Dabur Chyawanprash and an 80 per cent growth in Dabur Honey. Facing a stock-out situation in the market^ it has already made investments to meet the growing demand for such products.,27,05
2020-05-26,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/stock-markets/what-all-can-be-done-must-be-done-by-the-centre-angel-broking-ceo/article31677038.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,What all can be done^ must be done by the Centre: Angel Broking CEO,Vinay Agrawal^ first CEO of Angel Broking^ who has been developing successful business strategies and strong analytical skills for the broking house^ explains why the market is not satisfied with the ₹20-lakh-crore package from the Union Government. In an e-mail interview with BusinessLine^ he discusses various issues impacting market direction. Excerpts:With the government announcing a ₹20-lakh-crore package^ where do you see the markets going? Is it sufficient to stimulate market sentiment?Markets have had a mixed reaction to the government’s stimulus package^ with lack of actual spending by the government not being appreciated well by the markets. The stimulus package focusses more on credit than on actual spend. While the ₹20-lakh-crore stimulus package may seem large at 10 per cent of GDP^ it is still smaller in size as compared with the stimulus packages announced by countries like the US.The US has so far announced a fiscal package of $2.7 trillion (13 per cent of GDP) which includes cash transfers. Cash transfers have an immediate effect on driving demand^ which is the need of the hour for any economy. Lending money can lead to a revival^ but given the uncertain and tough times that is currently under way^ banks and NBFCs are wary of lending and have so far been risk averse^ parking on an average about ₹8 lakh crore with the RBI daily. Nothing seems to be sufficient under the present scenario^ but what all can be done^ must be done.So^ the markets are disappointed with the stimulus package...The markets were expecting some specific packages for the most stressed sectors but that has so far come a cropper. But given the government’s dwindling tax collections and relatively little room for enhancing the fiscal deficit as that could impact the sovereign rating^ the options would always be limited. But nonetheless^ opening up the defence sector^ focussing on ‘Make in India’^ structural reforms in the agriculture and power sectors^ and collateral-free guaranteed loan worth ₹3 lakh crore for MSMEs are steps in the right direction.The pressing need is kick-starting the economy^ as the lockdown is now being lifted in phases. But how it plays out in the coming weeks and months is going to be crucial. Further^ steps to ensure that credit flow happens through the banking as well as the NBFC channels are equally important^ and steps taken in this direction will be more than welcome. Tough times calls for tough measures^ and the markets definitely have high hopes from the government.Rating agencies^ experts and even the RBI now predict zero or negative GDP growth for India. As a market expert^ do you fear the worst is ahead?There is no doubt that the world economy is going in for a contraction this financial year^ with key economies such as the US^ Germany and France entering into recession. China is back on track^ with April witnessing automobile sales in excess of two million^ the highest level since June 2018. As far as India is concerned^ a latest report by United Nations pegs India’s growth in FY21 at 1.2 per cent^ which would still be far better than majority of the countries.But^ at the same time^ other economic agencies have forecast negative growth as well. Further^ India’s fiscal deficit is likely to rise this year^ towards 5 per cent plus as suggested by various forecasters. So^ the economic data ahead is bound to be negative^ but given their intelligence of the markets^ investors will be sector and stock specific^ focussing on those sectors such as telecom^ IT^ pharma^ and FMCG^ which are likely to be better placed to weather the current storm.Looking through the crystal ball^ one can tell that the times ahead is not going to be easy^ and investors will have to learn to live with volatility. If we see a containment of Covid-19 both domestically and globally^ then yes^ we could see a halt in the market correction^ but it is still early days to proclaim the same.Crude shock had impacted Angel Broking. What is its real impact and has the problem been sorted out? Are equity investors of Angel Broking being protected from the problem of your commodity vertical?It was for the first time in history that NYMEX WTI prices turned negative^ this downfall in price was unprecedented. In India^ due to Covid-19^ business hours for commodity markets was reduced to 1700 hours. Unfortunately^ clients with open positions did not get a chance to square off their positions. In this event our exposure was restricted to only ₹13.5 crore^ which is a minuscule amount considering our revenue and balance sheet size. While Angel had already provided for this amount^ we are currently seeing collection from the clients. This carries no risk to any of Angel’s clients.The timings have been revised now to 2330 hours again. We have a very robust and completely automated-risk management system in place which triggers off to insulate our clients from any risk. Moreover^ we always advise our clients to trade using strict stop losses at all times.Any important factors that investors should watch out for in the coming days?Investors are advised to keep vigil as different sets of economic data from the US^ China^ Euro zone have the potential to impact global as well as domestic markets. So^ the markets are set to remain volatile^ but yes^ with a significant decline in uncertainty and fear as compared to in March and April.Investing in tranches^ focussing only on quality stocks^ and keeping a long-term perspective are the need of the hour. Lastly^ markets are currently being driven mainly by two factors — liquidity and hopes of an early cure to Covid-19. So^ grasping the fact that the only certainty going forward^ at least for the next couple of quarters^ is enhanced volatility^ one will have to learn to live with it.,26,05
2020-05-25,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/variety/salman-khan-launches-personal-care-brand-to-sell-hand-sanitisers/article31669499.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Salman Khan launches personal care brand^ to sell hand sanitisers,For Salman Khan’s fans^ the festival of Eid usually marks the release of his latest films. But with the Covid-19 pandemic upending the Bollywood industry^ the star has decided to use this occasion to launch his personal care brand.This also marks Khan’s foray into hand-sanitisers^ a segment which has seen the entry of hundreds of new players in the past three months.Announcing the launch of his personal care brand FRSH^ in a Twitter post^ Khan said^ “Our plan was to launch deodorants. But the need of the hour is hand sanitisers. Hence we have launched these hand sanitisers under the brand FRSH.”“We will come out with deodorants too eventually. Also on the cards are body wipes and perfumes^” he added.He said that initially the hand sanitisers will be available online^ and they will make their début on store shelves gradually. “Coming soon to a store near you- FRSH hand sanitisers^” he said adding that the tag line for the new brand is^ “Raho FRSH^ Raho Safe.”Over the past few years^ Khan has been expanding his business ventures beyond making films and TV shows. He has been investing behind his private label brand Being Human^ which is known for apparel and accessories. In 2017^ he also launched Being Human e-cycles.From FMCG companies to personal care and beauty product makers and from alcohol players and distilleries to paint companies^ many players are making hand sanitisers in the country. While some of them have entered the space for commercial purposes^ but others such as distilleries^ sugar companies and liquor brands are making sanitisers to cater to the needs of the frontline health workers and police forces.Hand sanitisers come under the Essential Commodities Act and prices have been fixed by the Central government. Khan’s hand sanitisers are priced in line with this government directive and 100 ml bottle comes for ₹50^ while a 500 ml bottle is priced at ₹250.According to estimates by Nielsen^ nearly 153 new players entered the hand sanitiser space in India in March alone. Many new players have been announcing their entry into the hand sanitiser space^ in line with consumers’ increased focus on health and hygiene due to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.,25,05
2020-05-23,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/fmcg-value-growth-declined-34-in-april-due-to-lockdown-nielsen/article31652407.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,FMCG value growth declined 34% in April due to lockdown: Nielsen,The FMCG industry recorded a 34 per cent drop in value growth in April 2020 compared to the same period last year due to the nation-wide lockdown. According to research and insights firm Nielsen^ the decline was due to a sharp drop in sales clocked by traditional trade channel consisting of neighbourhood and kirana stores.Traditional trade value growth declined by as much 38 per cent in April as compared to the same period last year^ while modern trade value growth continued to witness value growth (5 per cent).“The sharp de-growth of traditional trade channels can be attributed to area and shop closures. On an average^ a traditional retail shop had to close for 12 days in April due to various restrictions^” Nielsen added. On an average^ while grocers had to shut down for eight days and chemists had to shut down for four days^ other traditional trades such as paan-shops and cosmetic shops had to shut down for a significantly higher number of days.Supply constraints and removal of promotional discounts by retailers and brands also led consumers to shell out more on packaged products during the March 23-May 3 period. “Average prices for key foods categories witnessed an increase in the lockdown phase. This was caused by retailer-led promotions slowing down^ and change in brand and pack mixes^” said Prasun Basu^ South Asia Zone President of Nielsen Global Connect.In modern trade stores^ the average price of packaged ghee grew by 18 per cent during lockdown Phase 1 and 19 per cent in Phase 2^ compared to the year-ago period. Similarly^ average prices of packaged atta grew by 9 per cent and 12 per cent compared to the year-ago period in the first and second lockdown phases respectively. Surge in average prices was also seen in categories such as soft drinks^ edible oils and packaged tea.At the same time^ contribution of private label brands increased across many categories in the lockdown phase as retailers leveraged on private labels to fill gaps in supplies caused by supply disruptions. “The value share of private label brands increased by 5-6 percentage points during lockdown as compared to the pre-Covid period of Dec-Jan-Feb period^” Nielsen added.Some of the other key trends included a decline in non-vegetarian food at modern trade during the lockdown due to supply constraint as well as lower purchase intent.Income affectedNearly 60 per cent consumers responded in an online survey conducted by Nielsen^ stating that Covid-19 has negatively impacted their household income. While respondents said they have increased spends on regular expenses^ they have reduced investments and focus is to maintain liquidity in terms of cash in hand or cash in banks.,23,05
2020-05-20,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/covid-19-crumples-paper-industry-says-crisil/article31634402.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Covid-19 crumples paper industry^ says CRISIL,The extended lockdown to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic has dealt a nasty blow to the highly fragmented paper industry in the country^ according to rating agency CRISIL.Around 80 per cent of the nation’s paper capacity of 25 million tonnes (mt) (750-800 mills) is clustered around six States that account for half of India’s gross domestic product. They are also major consumption hubs.The problem^ according to the note^ is that 40-45 per cent of these mills are in Covid-19 red zones and another 40-45 per cent in orange zones.Low demandThe industry is grappling with weak demand^ shortage of raw material and limited availability of labour^ which are affecting capacity utilisation. CRISIL Research expects demand for paper and cardboards to contract 10-15 per cent on-year^ affecting all categories of products.The shutdown of schools^ colleges and majority of offices has crimped demand for writing and printing (W&P) paper. Industrial paper usage has also rumpled because of weakness in the FMCG^ consumer durables and apparel segments^ which account for 50-60 per cent of such demand. To boot^ exports have fallen.Consequently^ the financials of paper-makers^ especially the small- and mid-sized ones (because of high fragmentation)^ will be materially affected.In the financial dispersion analysis for a set of 125 companies that account for 35-40 per cent of the total installed capacity and had a total debt of ₹20^370 crore as of FY2019^ 25 firms with ₹10^777-crore debt burden have an interest coverage ratio of 2^ and so are at high risk. The debt/Ebitda ratio is 3 for almost half of the sample set^ and almost a quarter of the sample set might face issues in meeting short-term obligations as the current ratio is less than 1.In the report^ titled ‘Covid Corollaries’^ CRSIL stated that the bulk of the capacity in the top six States are at risk. Almost half of the installed capacity of paper mills is in the red zones in the top six States which account for 80 per cent of installed capacity.,20,05

The company then swung into action to reconfigure its equipment and convert some of its cotton processing lines to make polyester swabs^ with limited resources and workforce in the early stages of the lockdown. But it managed to achieve it in 10 days^ said Jain.To expand capacity“We have the largest installed capacity in Asia to make cotton buds. We began manufacturing these specialised polyester swabs from the day we got approval from the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research)^ on May 5. Currently^ 10 per cent of the capacity is being used to make Covid polyester swabs and we are currently making 2 million swabs per week. By May-end we would be able to convert an additional 10 per cent of capacity to be able to produce 5 million swabs in a week^” Jain told BusinessLine.The company has focussed on various features for its polyester swabs^ such as elongated sticks to ensure medics maintain adequate distance while taking samples^ and thin swabs so that they are flexible enough for both nasopharyngeal and oropharnygeal samples.One of the key challenges in scaling up for the company has been that the production rate for Covid polyester swabs is much lower compared to cotton buds on the same lines.Lower-cost products“As testing ramps up further in the country^ we have the ability to make 30 million swaps per week. We believe by June-end we can achieve this. Due to high demand for these swabs globally^ imported swabs are priced currently in the range of ₹20-40. In comparison^ the cost of our domestically-produced swabs is ₹3.5 per swab. As we increase capacity^ we believe the cost can be brought down further^” said Jain.In many other markets such as the US and the France^ cotton bud makers have managed to pivot their manufacturing capabilities to make specialised swabs for Covid-19 testing. “We have already been approached by international agencies and kit makers to supply these swabs to them. Our key focus for now is to ensure domestic demand is fulfilled and then we may look at exports^” he added.The FMCG company^ however^ does not believe this will become its core business in the long term.Set up in 1998^ Suparshva Swabs claims to be one of the leading manufacturer and exporters of cotton and wood based personal hygiene products such as cotton buds^ cotton pads^ facial tissues^ baby wipes and absorbent cotton rolls.,20,05

Considering the uncertainty around Covid-19 spread and the government’s containment measures^ consumers may increase stocking period of essentials and staples from seven days currently to 15 days.“Sales had picked up from mid-March till April 1. By then the consumers had stocked up their monthly groceries. We saw demand picking up again from April 25 till May 3^ after which sales have come down. But over the last two days^ we are finding demand coming up and from May 15 onward^ we see it picking up^” said Angshu Mallick^ Deputy CEO^ Adani Wilmar Limited^ addressing a media video conference.“As there is still uncertainty over the normalisation^ the stock-up period for consumers may go up from the seven days currently to 15 days. So^ demand for bulk packs will also be seen as a result^” said Mallick.Uninterrupted supplyAdani Wilmar^ which sells its food products under the Fortune brand^ recently launched sulphur-less sugar in consumer packs of 5 kg in the Eastern markets of West Bengal^ Jharkhand and Odisha^ while it plans to cover North and West in the subsequent months. This completes the portfolio of staples for Fortune^ which already has rice^ wheat^ dals and aata^ besides range of edible oils.The company stated that it was working hard to keep all its plants operational to ensure that there is no shortage of edible oil and food products in the market. It has managed to ensure uninterrupted supply of edible oil and food products in the market even though almost half of its plants^ including those in Surat^ Khargone in MP^ East Godavari^ Kurnool^ Nellore and Dakshin Kannada districts^ are in the Covid-19 hotspots^ said Mallick.“At this point of time^ our responsibility is to keep our factories running and ensure there is no shortage of edible oil and food. We are handling enormous volumes of about 3 million tonnes of edible oil coming to our factories^ we process it and pack it to transport for market^” said Mallick^ adding that capacity utilisation across plants had declined to 50 per cent immediately after the lockdown was announced.The impact on capacity utilisation was primarily because of logistical issues^ unavailability of raw materials^ and worker shortage. With several easing measures by the government^ plant utilisation has improved to 70 per cent now.However^ currently^ Adani Wilmar is facing some operational challenges in terms of availability of truck drivers^ raw material and packaging material. This is a fallout of migrant workers returning to their home towns following the lockdown.Transporting through train“Our suppliers are also facing the same issues^ i.e. shortage of workers^ logistics^ and raw material availability. However^ we are working closely with them to sort out these issues at the earliest^” he informed.In order to reduce its dependence on the road network^ Adani Wilmar has increased transportation of products through trains. The company is using mini rakes with capacity of 1^000 tonnes^ instead of the full rakes of 3^000 tonnes capacity to transport limited production and dispatch capacity.,15,05
2020-05-15,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/new-players-emerge-in-grocery-delivery-space-as-online-purchases-skyrocket/article31579951.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,New players emerge in grocery delivery space as online purchases skyrocket,As big-budget grocery e-commerce players struggle to meet the burgeoning consumer demand due to last-mile delivery bottlenecks^ the Covid-19 pandemic has opened doors for several new players to enter the retail delivery industry. Companies like StoreSe.In^ JustMyRoots^ HouseJoy Mart and Wow Momo Essentials^ among others^ have launched their grocery delivery operations within the last two months and are already seeing 3x-5x growth.“We were piloting a new grocery delivery platform since January and had no plans to launch it now. With this unprecedented demand coming^ and delivery players not being able to meet it^ in March we made a quick move to launch StoreSe.in^” said Abhinav Pathak^ CEO & Cofounder^ Perpule.StoreSe is part of Perpule which is a series funded company retail-tech startup. The company has invested ₹1 crore in it. It currently operates in two cities and is adding 20 per cent sales on a weekly basis since its launch.Another player with a similar story is Near.store. The Mumbai-based retail-tech startup was founded in 2018. The company’s founder Ashish Kumar saw an opportunity in the grocery delivery segment right before the lockdown and launched the portal in March this year. On a month-on-month basis^ the Near.store has seen a 6x growth in sales.On a daily basis^ StoreSe caters to “a single-digit thousand orders” and Wow Momo Essentials claims to deliver 2^500 orders^ whereas^ JustMyRoots and Near.store daily order volumes are approximately 250-300 and 300-500 respectively.The big fish in the industry too saw a surge in demand. According to a report last month^ BigBasket had 2.83 lakh daily orders^ compared to 1.5 lakh before the shutdown^ while Grofers serviced 1.9 lakh daily orders against one lakh before the crisis. Amazon Pantry too saw a growth of 2x-2.5x in comparison to the pre-lockdown demand.Demand-supply mismatchHowever^ unlike the small players^ this surge became a bottleneck for these players creating a demand and supply mismatch due to backend disruption and inadequate manpower.Ruchi Shah^ a South Mumbai resident living with her grandmother since the lockdown had begun^ was struggling to get a slot on online-grocery delivery platforms for several weeks. “I used to sit with my phone for hours checking Grofers and Big Basket to get a slot. Luckily^ if there was a slot available^ the products I needed were out of stock. My friends suggested DMart and Big Bazaar’s portals but neither of them delivers on my pincode.” Eventually^ a neighbour helped her procure groceries from a local kirana store.Just like Shah^ several others struggled to get their essentials delivered to their doorstep. Several customers also took to Twitter to express their angst. By the end of last month^ these three players went on a hiring spree of delivery partners whereas Grofers decided to deliver 24x7 to complete the backlog.Though things are getting back to normal for them^ this slowdown became a boon for small players. They made a rapid move to go hyperlocal and cater to the demand.The differentiator for these new-age players is their supply chain^ whether it is partnering with kirana stores^ distributors^ FMCG brands^ giving tech-support^ or providing delivery fleet.These companies work on an asset-light model^ unlike the big players which own the stock at their warehouses.JustMyRoots gets its stocks from select distributors of FMCG companies and delivers products via a third-party delivery app along with its own fleet.Whereas Store.Se has partnered with kirana stores and large format retail stores and has partnered ridesharing service companies like Meru and Ola to deliver their products. Whereas Near.store procures its stock from both kirana stores and FMCG companies directly and uses a third party fleet to deliver these products.F&B company^ Wow Momo’s retail arm^ Wow Momo Essentials has partnered with FMCG companies to procure essentials on a consignment basis and has registered on Swiggy and Zomato Market to deliver them. Being an F&B company^ its sales were tapering because of the lockdown. Hence^ it is currently using its manpower and restaurant space for Wow Momo Essentials.Where players like Wow Momo were struggling to make sales^ food-tech aggregators too were bearing the brunt of the lockdown. Recently^ Zomato too launched Zomato Market to deliver essentials.Speaking to BusinessLine^ Mohit Sardana^ COO-Food Delivery^ Zomato^ said while the company has always been focused on food^ the grocery segment is another touchpoint within the same ecosystem. “It was always on the radar^ and therefore we explored it and were able to expand so quickly^” he said.Zomato Market already has 3^700 partners^ including FMCG players^ retail chains^ and local kirana stores. Zomato Market already constitutes more than 35 per cent of its current order volume. “Our differentiator is that essentials are delivered within 60 minutes^” said Sardana.Zomato’s differentiator is delivery in 60 minutes^ while payment gateway app Insta Mojo’s differentiator is the registration of merchants on its app within 10 minutes.Will this stickiness be there post the lockdown?According to Praveen Khandelwal^ Secretary-General^ Confederation of All India Traders^ if these new models have come up in such unprecedented circumstances and withstand the pressure of the lockdown^ then “in normal conditions they can be a game-changer. Along with this^ the very low cost of the delivery system and the time period of delivering the goods shortly after placing an order are liked by all.”Over the next six months^ the asset-light StoreSe plans to scale up to 100 plus cities whereas JustMyRoots plans to cater to over 200 cities by the end of FY21. Wow Momo Essentials plans to expand deliveries for niche essential items in the near future^ whereas Zomato plans to stick on to delivering essentials and food at the moment.,15,05
2020-05-14,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/cobots-expected-to-play-increasing-role-in-post-covid-19-automation/article31579582.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Cobots expected to play increasing role in post-Covid-19 automation,A dipstick sampling of the mood in the manufacturing industries reveals a bent of mind for increased automation^ in the post-Covid-19 world. As industry — particularly the MSME segment — grapples with its absent migrant labour and social-distancing imperatives^ every manufacturer is considering options to automate his shop floor^ with a marked preference for robots.“This pandemic has strengthened our resolve to continue to invest not only in robotics^ but in a whole lot of automation solutions that will make our manufacturing systems less people-dependent and more intelligent^” says Ram Venkataramani^ Director at mid-sized auto components manufacturer^ India Pistons Ltd.Not that robots need a virus crisis to market them. Over the last couple of decades^ thanks to their declining prices due to massive scale-up in China^ robots have been marching into factories. Data from the International Federation of Robotics^ an industry body headquartered in Frankfurt^ Germany^ illustrates this fact. In a recent publication^ IFR notes that between 2005 and 2008^ the average annual number of industrial robots sold globally was about 1.15 lakh units^ but after the financial-crisis induced dip to 60^000 units in 2009^ the demand bounced back to grow steadily to 4.22 lakh units in 2018.Now^ here is the nub: at the end of 2018^ the world had a robotic stock of 24.4 lakh units. However^ Dr. Andreas Bauer^ Chairman IFR Industrial Robot Suppliers Committee^ expects another 20 lakh units of new industrial robots to be installed in factories around the world between 2020 and 2022 — nearly doubling the robot stock^ a datapoint that underscores the invasion of shop floors by robots. The Covid-19 crisis may temporarily impede their growth^ but as Venkataramani notes^ the crisis may galvanise robots’ adoption. Observing that the key to automation is the cost related of it^ Venkataramani told BusinessLine^ “the time to do it is now^ when the market demand is low.”Within the segment of ‘industrial robots’^ there is a sub-segment that is growing even faster — the collaborative robots^ or cobots. Unlike the heavy giants that you see in^ say^ large car plants^ the cobots are small ones^ can stand alongside a worker^ can be easily moved from place to place and shop floor workers can program them for simple^ repeated tasks. These are not necessarily cheaper (though they are likely to become) than conventional industrial robots^ but their size and ease of doing business with them make them the darlings of factory managers.Covid and cobotSome see the Covid-19 episode pushing cobot sales. As industries resume production with truncated work force^ “manufacturers are looking for solutions to ensure that there is no loss of efficiency^” notes Pradeep David^ General Manager in-Charge of South Asia at Danish company^ Universal Robots^ which is the world’s largest cobot manufacturer. Pointing that the bespoke cobots are within reach of the MSME sector^ given the machines’ low demand for space and maintenance^ he says they “democratise automation”.Citing an MIT Technology Review study^ David told BusinessLine that there is 85 per cent reduction in idle time when humans and robots work together. Universal Robots “definitely expects increasing demand for cobots in India”^ especially in pharma and FMCG sectors.The demand for cobots is global. According to Maya Xiao^ a researcher at market research company^ Interact Analysis^ which provides market intelligence on automation^ the demand for cobots grew 31.3 per cent in volume in 2019^ after a big boom in the previous year. In 2018^ 19^266 cobots were shipped^ for $567 million — these numbers were up 68 per cent and 56.6 per cent respectively^ over 2017^ according to an Interact Analysis study. Electronics and semiconductors and automotive industries are the biggest users today^ but more industries are picking up cobots. “With the further development of new application scenarios and breakthrough technologies^” Xiao writes in Robotics Business Review^ “the cobot market is projected to reach $5.6 billion in 2027.”Jan Zhang^ Senior Research Director at Interact Analysis^ says that because cobots are more flexible and easy to use^ “we expect many small and mid-sized companies that have not previously used automation^ to consider cobots as a result of Covid-19.” Zhang said that apart from industries such as automotive^ metals and electronics^ cobots are also very useful in businesses like cafes and restaurants. “We expect that many companies in industry sectors that do not traditionally use automation will be considering employing cobots after Covid-19^” she said in an emailed response to BusinessLine’s questions.Zhang expects the current pandemic to weaken demand for automation in 2020^ but to accelerate it in following years.Manufacturing cobotsIndia has today less than a thousand cobots in operation. Bajaj Auto was one of the earlier adopters of cobots and has a hundred of them at its Chakan plant^ doing a variety of jobs from material handling to bolt tightening to welding. Carl Zeiss^ L'Oréal and Aurolabs are among the bigger companies that use cobots^ but there are a number of MSMEs too – New Engineering Works^ Jamshedpur; Shruti Engineers^ Pune; and SMEW^ Ahmedabad^ to name a few.If the domestic demand for cobots is set to grow^ can India manufacture these machines? Yes and no^ says Ash Sharma^ Managing Director of Interact Analysis. China is the biggest producer — it accounts for a third of the world’s cobot production — and Taiwan is big too. At India’s level of consumption^ it wouldn’t make sense to make the hardware here. However^ software is a different story.“Much of the value of a cobot is added at the software stage^” Sharma told BusinessLine. “India’s leading software clusters in cities like Bengaluru^ Chennai and Pune will increasingly enter the global industrial automation markets and this will include designing software for cobots^” he said.In any case^ the cobots story in India is not about their manufacture but use. Since they allow partial and gradual automation of a plant^ the machines are to be in demand^ especially from the MSME sector^ which is now armed with an expansive stimulus package by the government.,14,05

This partnership will be expanded to enable the delivery of Lay’s^ Kurkure and Quaker Oats products to consumers in over 20 cities in the coming days^ according to sources.Last-mile deliveryLeading FMCG companies are strengthening their presence on e-commerce channels and focusing on ways to deliver their products directly to consumers^ as they are battling supply chain challenges due to the nationwide lockdown and consumers increasingly ordering online. Players like Swiggy have recently entered the grocery and essential products space.Through such tie-ups^ packaged food companies are hoping to leverage the food aggregators’ hyperlocal reach to ensure last-mile delivery of its snack brands to consumers during the lockdown. Swiggy’s delivery partners will directly picking up a consumer’s order from the local distributors of the brands.New online shoppersSources said the company is expected to further step up focus on direct-to-consumer delivery space in the country^ in line with its global strategy.Earlier this week^ in the US^ PepsiCo Inc announced the launch of PantryShop.com and Snacks.com^ two direct-to-consumer websites where shoppers can order an assortment of PepsiCo’s food and beverage brands.According to a recent study on the retail sector by EY India^ the structural shift towards online channels during the crisis will persist and continue in the long-term. It added that adoption of digital channels by new online shoppers^ such as older consumers and rural consumers^ will continue to accelerate.,13,05

These CXO positions command CTC between ₹1 crore and ₹6 crore per annum.“Almost 70-80 per cent of our CXO searches are on hold indefinitely since March. Four offers made by organisations have been scrapped and another 10-12 offers have been put on hold for at least 6-9 months or^ in many cases^ indefinitely. We are advising candidates not to resign from their positions until such time that the offer is sure to come through^” Jyoti Bowen Nath^ Managing Partner at executive search firm^ Claricent Partners^ told BusinessLine.Some global-oriented roles like that of a marketing director will cease to exist and some others such as Head of sales will demand a strong background in e-commerce^ in keeping with the need of the times^ she said.Top job title searchesWhile organisations continue to lay off employees and effect pay cuts across all levels^ CXOs are also bearing the brunt of these actions^ as evident in the sharp spike in CXO job searches over the last few weeks.“We have noticed 5^000 searches for job titles including CEO^ CFO^ COO^ CTO^ CIO^ CSO and CMO over the last 30 days^ which is unprecedented. These are candidates with over 15 years of experience^ who are searching on LinkedIn^ Naukri^ Monster and other job portals. And these candidates are not from start-ups or entrepreneurial ventures but work in well-established firms^” observed Kamal Karanth^ co-founder of specialist staffing firm Xpheno. He said none of the CXO positions that Xpheno has hired for have been revoked but^ they have been put on hold indefinitely.“One lady CXO of a tech engineering firm who was to join an FMCG major withdrew her resignation and stayed on because of the sheer uncertainty of the situation. Yet another local centre head of a technology major messaged me desperately in the wee hours of the morning asking for a suitable role for which he was ready to relocate to Mumbai^ Bengaluru^ Hyderabad or Chennai. A large tech firm for which we effected 8 Director level-and-above hires has pushed the joining month from July 1 to September 1^” recounted Karanth.CXO hiring has gone slow by 60 per cent wherein^ the majority of organisations are adopting a ‘wait and watch’ and pessimistic approach^ pointed out Ronesh Puri^ Managing Director of Executive Access. “April has been a muted month. However CXO hiring has picked up in the last 10 days with a few e-joinings as they continue to work out of their current locations. Organisations are also realising this is the right time to hire talent^ but^ with a 60-70 per cent variable pay component instead of the usual 40-50 per cent pre-Covid^” he said.One of the few sectors that still continues to hire is GICs (Global In-house Centres) of multinational corporations. “Pre-COVID we expected 50 per cent growth in hiring in 2020 however^ now we expect flat growth. We have visibility into 1^500 open positions from 3 years to 15 years of experience which we have to fill in the next two months^ of this^ 15 per cent are for Director level and above positions. Access to specialised skills like data engineering/analytics^ greater control of work output^ continuity of knowledge --- technology being a big differentiator for their business in these turbulent times --- are the topmost reasons for GICs continuing to hire” said Vikram Ahuja^ co-founder^ Talent500 by ANSR^ which specialises in talent acquisition for GICs of Fortune500 companies.,11,05
2020-05-11,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/the-retail-sector-outlook-post-covid-19/article31555502.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,The retail sector outlook post Covid-19,That Covid-19 has been humanity’s biggest disruptor of life and businesses is an understatement. In the context where the online and multi-channel impact were being seen across the world on physical retails including malls^ the corona scare might become a game changer with regard to retail across the world. In short^ the future is not easy to predict^ even though a lot of gloomy reports about retail are doing the rounds.As retail has four important variables which have very different dynamics^ one single outlook for the sector will not work.Retail segment: The effect on mass merchandise stores as compared to lifestyle formats^ including malls^ is going to be very different because of consumption as also business dynamics.Supply chain and inventory impact: While some of the categories would be affected by the inventory pile-up due to the lockdown^ several other categories might end up running into severe supply issues and therefore stock out situations^ as manufacturing is almost at a standstill for various categories.Fund flow and working capital impact: Retail is essentially about the fast rotation of working capital^ which is inventory. Clearly the inventory status is going to affect this in a significant manner.Shopper behaviour effect: Panic buying has been seen for essential products. However^ essential products have various categories and the consumption of these is not uniform. For example^ panic buying of biscuits would not affect future purchases. Whereas if a person has purchased extra shampoo^ toothpaste or even groceries^ they are not going to brush their teeth four times or cook extra food because of this. Similar is the case with lifestyle products^ high ticket items^ etc. Some of them might even see a spurt in sales while many categories might witness muted sales.Impact on key segmentsThe impact of these variables on the key segments of Indian retail would be as follows:Kirana or the small standalone stores: The impact on them might be minimal and could even be positive to an extent. Their business model has a tight OPEX and core base of regular shoppers. If the supply side is sustained^ these stores might even see a growth in patronage. Supply chain constraints might also not hit them very hard as manufacturers always focus on distribution to this segment since it constitutes a significant majority of the retail sector.The only downside they might face is a cash-flow crunch. Kirana stores are known to offer rotational credit. Even if they reduce this during this period^ their cash flow might be affected because many of them have to go and pick up the stocks paying cash.Mass merchandise stores: Supermarkets might have a relatively lesser impact because they are largely selling essential products. However^ hypermarkets might face the brunt of this shutdown because most of them are in malls. Even the standalone ones need to sell food and FMCG categories. As hypermarkets tend to have much higher inventory levels^ that is going to be a serious issue.In the food segment itself^ many products with shorter shelf life like juices are going to expire and might have to be written off. Returning such stocks to vendors appears farfetched. Their profitability would also be hit because the higher margin categories like apparel would not sell in the lockdown and might have lower sales even after the lockdown. The inventory of various other categories like apparel^ etc.^ in a hypermarket would have to be liquidated through massive discounts.Consumer durables & IT product stores: These stores would also be hit hard. First is the loss of sale from the seasonal high of certain categories linked to summer like air-conditioners. Next would be the supply chain bottlenecks that manufacturers would face because of disruption from Chinese vendors. Last but not the least is the shopper behaviour of postponing high ticket purchases in a period of uncertainty and gloom.Apparel and other lifestyle stores: One of their biggest challenges is going to be excess stocks. The existing stocks from the previous season plus the summer lines would put tremendous pressure on these businesses. Physical stores would have to liquidate stocks of the previous season to create space for fresh stocks. End-of-season sales and massive discounts might have a very limited effect because of the current sentiment.If the next season lines are usually sourced from China^ the retailer might have some relief as orders might not have been placed or the stocks might not have been even sent by the vendor. The other dimension of inventory from China is the sentiment and concern about products from China. Any retailer who has inventory of such products might be affected.Apparel as a category might escape such a situation to some extent as a lot of products are being sourced from Tirupur as also countries like Bangladesh and Taiwan.Discount formats might benefit as they would be able to source inventory at throwaway prices as their shoppers are drawn by low prices and not the latest fashion or trend.Online retail : Online retail is again not a single segment and most of what I have mentioned earlier about the various categories and segments would apply to the different online retailers. In addition to this would be the challenge to restart supplies from their various smaller non-food vendors. Medium and small-scale enterprises are being hit hard by this crisis and lockdown. They form a significant chunk of the vendor base for various non-food categories. Their business impact would trickle down to the online retailer.Buyer behaviourLastly^ let me explain the potential shopper and buyer behaviour after the corona scare is over or at least is reduced.First is the aspect of money in hand^ which is critical for retail. Although the government has appealed to businesses to continue paying their employees^ this cannot be for an indefinite period. In case of any move to contain the manpower cost by salary cuts or manpower rationalisation^ the spending sentiment is going to be badly hit. Even those with no such cuts or employment threat would become very cautious and tighten their purse strings. All discretionary categories^ especially lifestyle products^ would be severely hit because of this.Next comes shopper’s preference^ of online vs offline. Assuming that the buying sentiment is not negatively affected^ there is going to be a surge in buying after this crisis is over. This would interestingly be more for physical retail stores. After the lockdown experience shoppers are raring to go out. So^ experience would become an important aspect of shopping and hence the appeal of physical stores would be more than online purchases^ at least for the medium term. Functional purchases or known brand purchases driven by discounts would continue to be online driven.There is a word of caution to retailers^ especially the lifestyle formats. The shopper with money and seeking experiential shopping would expect very good service. If retailers start to cut down on store staff to minimise the cost impact of Covid-19^ it would be a very short-sighted approach.In summary^ I do not foresee any dramatic downturn to the retail sector. However^ I am qualifying this with the caveat that this is hugely dependent on shopper sentiment not being hit by wage cuts or job losses.

Grade A properties will be more attractive to occupiers due to health and safety considerations^ the study said.“The extended lockdown in the country will also impact the under-construction projects resulting in an attenuated supply in the short-term. However^ absorptions and demand in warehousing sector is likely to take a positive turn in the medium-to-long term phase^” said Yogesh Shevade^ Head–Industrial Services^ India^ JLL.Pent-up demand and project closures may be pushed by two quarters with an expected spark in activities by fourth quarter. However^ the fundamentals of the sector remain strong and the biggest advantage for India remains in the potential to capture manufacturing demand as companies re-position their global supply chains from a business continuity planning (BCP) standpoint.Impact on logistics sectorThe lockdown has frozen supply chains across multiple sectors^ both in production and stockpiling.“These restrictions have also limited transactions in the growth-oriented e-commerce sector^” the report added.However^ after the lockdown^ a change in consumer behaviour is expected to benefit e-commerce and e-payments^ which is already being observed through movements of essential commodity.The report highlights that the medium-term will experience an uptake in demand of urban logistics and in-city warehousing. The logistics sector is expected to see long-term growth as e-commerce expands and with enhanced infrastructure support.Sectors such as FMCG^ e-commerce^ pharmaceuticals and cold storage will see an increased growth and demand for the additional warehousing spaces. On the other hand^ a few sectors like auto^ heavy machinery and chemicals^ may look for short-term rent abetments for one-to-two months.“Investors might remain cautious^ critically scrutinising portfolios before deploying capital for investments. However^ the industrial asset class might emerge as a safer investment option compared to other real estate asset classes^” the report added.,11,05

The revenue during this quarter was ₹656.02 crore^ a 6.19 per cent fall from the year-ago period’s ₹699.34 crore.The company was forecasting high single-digit sales growth for the quarter before the lockdown. But following the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19^ business operations were severely disrupted across the country^ it said in a statement.“In the near term^ we will focus on scaling up our operations to maximise the availability of our products to meet consumer needs^ while following health and safety guidelines by the government authorities. With the strength of our product portfolio^ we are well-positioned to serve the needs of our consumers by offering superior propositions and value across different price segments^” said Madhusudan Gopalan^ Managing Director^ Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care Ltd.,08,05

This was even done for shorter distances^ lesser volumes and high-value cargo requiring careful handling.Impressed by the services being offered by the railways^ a few FMCG majors^ may continue riding the trains post-COVID-19 crisis as well.P&G's largest factory^ at Mandideep near Bhopal^ which makes sanitary products^ has started using trains for the first time. In fact^ P&G has booked vehicle parcel units exclusively to move its products^ said a railway official. The products include Vicks^ Whisper sanitary napkins and Pampers (diapers). These parcel vans have been moving from the Bhopal division of Indian Railways to Nizamuddin in Delhi^ Yeshwanthpur in Bengaluru^ and Howrah in Kolkata during the lockdown period^ according to officials.Indian Railways is now able to move time-tabled parcel trains as its tracks are emptier with almost no passenger trains running. ITC has traditionally used trains for large volumes of raw materials such as wheat and finished goods such as salt over long distances for many years. But S Sivakumar^ Group Head^ Agri-Business^ ITC Ltd said that with disruption in the road transport post-Covid coupled with the enterprising approach taken by the Railways officials^ the company has begun using railways in previously unimagined ways.""For smaller volumes and shorter distances^ road transport was the preferred mode conventionally. Now^ with Railways offering parcel trains to carry small volumes also^ both on time-tabled routes as well as customer-specific routes^ they become relevant."" Sivakumar said.Impressed by the timely connectivity^ ITC started opting for parcel trains even though it found its parcel rates to be higher than the then prevailing truck freights on similar routes. ""With a positive experience during these times of crisis^ Railways and the industry can collaborate even more closely in future also^ to design more customised transportation opportunities along identified lanes^"" Sivakumar hoped.Similar experiences were shared by Gaurav Singhal^ manager of Gaurav Textiles^ who sent thermal packing material for medicines from his factory in Meerut (Uttar Pradesh) to Goa^ in parcel train for the first time. “The railway officials helped us get requisite clearances required to move our trucks in the last mile^ and informed us when our cargo will reach^” he said.Railways^ which has a parcel tracking system^ is also working towards improving the visibility of the parcels across more stations using its IT systems. Railways' parcel vans are using trains for below 500 km as well as long distances cargo^ said another railway official.E-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart are also using trains. Several divisions and zones started loading more parcel cargo than the same time last year. ""Despite the continuation of lockdown^ West Central Railway^ which houses Bhopal division^ has loaded more cargo in the first 24 days of April^ compared to the same time last year^"" an official said.This trend of cargo-shift from the road to railways is getting accentuated because trucks traffic flow is still far from normal despite attempts to restore normalcy. “There is still a lack of enough co-ordination between State-level authorities regarding essential transport in certain regions. Higher rates are being charged especially for inter-State transport^ with an increase [of] upwards of 40 per cent and there is a definite shortage of labour on the ground which is also affecting last-mile deliveries"" said Kartik Johari^ Vice-President^ Nobel Hygiene.",08,05

It was as high as 30 per cent per of consumers in mid-March onwards^ and then further rose by another 30 per cent by March end.But in the past few weeks^ it recorded a slight dip even though it is still high (40 per cent more than usual)^ according to a report by SnapBizz.The report^ which outlined FMCG consumer buying patterns from India in during the Covid-19 outbreak^ attributes the spike in mid-March to panic buying followed by a low-spell till Easter weekend. Post which^ the sales improved.This steep rise was also because more people stayed at home and cooked at home^ and more premium products being pushed by retailers due to more availability and margins.The study also found a decline in the number of Kirana stores operating ever since the lockdown took effect for various reasons. These included interference from police^ lack of staff or lack of supplies.SnapBizz Founder and CEO Prem Kumar said: “In this current time of lockdown^ we have been witnessing the steady and continued operations of local Kirana stores. They have been trying their best to keep their stores open^ selling whatever they have been supplied with at best prices without taking advantage of the situation.”Supply chain shiftDuring the lockdown period^ consumers are chasing retailers for supplies^ while the retailers are chasing the distributors and brands for replenishments.SnapBizz is backed by venture capital firms such as Jungle Ventures^ Taurus^ Blume Ventures and strategic investors such as Nielsen^ Qualcomm^ AUO and Ratan Tata.

At this time^ we are focusing on the movement of food and grocery items of daily use to our consumers^ subject to all safety norms. We will continue to invest behind our core portfolios^ while also adapting to shifts in consumer behaviour that may be brought about by this unprecedented human crisis^” said Saugata Gupta^ MD & CEO^ Marico Ltd.Disruption in supply chainThe domestic business was impacted by the disruption in supply chain operations caused by the lockdown enforced in March due to Covid-19^ said Marico. The business would have delivered flattish revenue growth in the quarter^ had these disruptions not occurred^ the company noted.The revenue from operations during the quarter under review stood at ₹1^496 crore^ down by 7.022 per cent from the year-ago quarter’s ₹1^609 crore.The net profit for FY20 was ₹1^043 crore^ down by 7.78 per cent from the previous year’s ₹1^131 crore.Marico witnessed some encouraging signs in demand in its core portfolios until early March^ which sharply diminished as economic activity progressively slowed and adherence to social distancing norms became an imperative^ it said.In the last week of March^ the company was able to record sales largely in the Saffola Oils and Foods portfolio. The India business managed to post low single digit volume growth in secondary sales in the quarter^ it said.The stress in personal care categories heightened during this period^ while the foods and allied categories^ which were growing healthily earlier as well^ gained disproportionately with households stocking up these items in the days leading to the lockdown^ the company noted.Challenges for the traditional channel in the rural and urban markets mounted during the quarter^ while modern trade and e-commerce grew healthily and gained higher salience in the India business^ it said.With Covid-19 turning into a pandemic^ the overseas geographies were also impacted in varying degrees^ it said. Its international business declined by six per cent in constant currency terms with MENA and South Africa businesses posting sharp drops^ while Bangladesh and Vietnam still ended in the green^ given relatively limited restrictions imposed in these regions in March.While EBITDA was down four per cent YoY^ gross margins improved marginally by 22 bps^ due to the unfavourable portfolio mix in the India business^ it said.While the company holds its medium term aspiration of delivering 8-10 per cent volume growth and 13-15 per cent revenue growth^ the near term is currently unpredictable^ it said.Focus areasIt will focus on right pricing and availability of goods to the consumer to manoeuvre through the current crisis^ it said. “We will continue to invest behind brand building to support market growth initiatives in core categories and expansion into adjacent categories^” it added. In the near term^ the company will also reallocate spends from non-media to media channels. Spends on the digital platforms will continue to rise^ it said.In FY21^ the company will strive to maintain the operating margin at FY20 levels^ it said. However^ the company would be comfortable maintaining operating margin at 19 per cent plus over the medium term.,04,05
2020-05-03,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/policy/cii-for-greater-industrial-activities-in-districts-with-high-economic-performance/article31494785.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,CII for greater industrial activities in districts with high economic performance,At a time when the government has decided to provide some relaxations in restrictions during the third phase of the nationwide lockdown starting from May 4^ the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Sunday called for a greater industrial activities in districts with high economic performance.The industry body also called for “economic contribution of districts to be taken into consideration while classifying lockdown zones.”“Districts with high economic activity should resume all industrial and business operations^ including in containment zones^ with highest safety protocols^” CII said in a report^ ‘Strategy Note on Resumption of Economic Activities in Industrial Area.’The suggestions followed the notification^ issued on May 1 by the Centre^ on graded exit from the coronavirus- related lockdown.‘Focused strategy’ neededThe third phase of lockdown necessitates “a focused strategy to minimise economic contraction due to Covid-19”^ without compromising on efforts to control the contagion^ the trade body said in a statement.“Prioritising districts with heavy presence of economic and industrial activities with continued operations^ accompanied by strictest precautions^ can help enterprises to remain financially sustainable while averting job losses^” CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.The industry body also said while the protracted lockdown in the country^ necessitated by the rapid spread of Covid-19^ has also caused enormous stress to the financial sustainability of many businesses.CII’s suggestionIn its strategy note^ it requested that the top districts should be identified based on variables like their contribution to country’s GDP^ or presence of industrial estates and clusters or registration of enterprises in a district.Instead of the current practice of categorising the entire district as a ‘Red zone’^ the CII has suggested the need for classifying zones as ‘Containment’^ ‘Orange’ and ‘Green’ within an industrial district.“Economic activities^ in varying degrees of relaxation^ should be permitted in all areas of this district^ but health and safety protocols would differ from zone to zone^” it said.The Containment zone may be a street^ mohalla or factory building where positive cases have been detected^ the industry body said.It has suggested that close surrounding areas can be classified as Orange zones^ where industrial activity can be continued with strict precautionary measures and monitoring.The distinction of essential and non-essential items should be removed and all factories should be permitted to restart^ the industry body said. “Aggressive measures are required to ensure that an industrial district moves from ‘Red’ to ‘Orange’ and ‘Green’ within 21 days.“The cost of undertaking precautionary measures by way of repeated sanitation^ wearing of PPE^ masks^ monitoring^ group testing etc. will be much less than the economic loss^ if businesses in such high performing districts have to remain shut for longer duration^” Banerjee said.Govt’s orderThe government has permitted industrial estates^ SEZ and industrial townships with restricted entry within urban areas of ‘red zones’ to commence operations.“CII submitted that all industrial units^ including in non-notified industrial areas and standalone units^ be allowed to function in urban areas. These should include non-essential goods and services as well^” the statement said.The body also called for limited public transport to function to enable workers and self-employed people to reach the industrial areas.‘Green’ zones within an industrial district^ on other hand^ should be allowed to work with relaxed restrictions but in adherence to strict health and safety protocols prescribed by the authorities.,03,05
2020-05-04,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/e-commerce-firms-gearing-up-to-deliver-non-essential-products-in-orange-and-green-zones/article31488051.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,E-commerce firms get set to deliver goods in orange^ green zones in ‘challenging’ times,As several States have begun issuing fresh notifications for lockdown 3.0^ in line with the new Ministry of Home Affairs guidelines^ e-commerce companies said they are gearing up to start delivering non-essential products in orange and green zones.But^ industry players pointed to on-ground challenges regarding supply chains^ such as access to warehouses located in red zones^ which may limit availability of product categories in green and orange zones. According to Home Ministry guidelines^ in the red zones^ e-commerce firms can only deliver essential products.Srinivas Mothey^ Senior Vice-President^ Paytm Mall^ said^ “We would be going live with our key categories including consumer electronics^ laptops^ home^ and fashion from Monday. While we will continue to deliver in essentials in all zones^ non-essential categories would be opened for orange and green zones.”“Our teams^ as well as logistics partners^ have taken all prior permissions from local authorities and would follow all guidelines set by the government for different zones. Our suppliers^ logistics partners^ and most importantly offline shopkeeper base are all set to go online^” he said. By Sunday evening^ Karnataka^ Maharashtra^ Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh among others had notified new guidelines for the extended lockdown period till May 17.Rajneesh Kumar^ SVP & Chief Corporate Affairs Officer^ Flipkart Group^ said^ “Our seller support team is providing constant online counsel and support to sellers on our platform to help them resume operations over the next couple of days complying with the government directives. We are working with lakhs of sellers and MSMEs across India and helping them prepare their businesses and workforce to make products available for consumers in this time of need as they continue to stay indoors^” he added.Industry players and experts^ however^ said that supply chain may still continue to face constraints. A senior executive with an e-commerce company said^ “Many of our seller clusters are in key urban centres^ which fall under red zones and hence there are still challenges for them^ in terms of being able to access their warehouses. We believe this will limit the supply of products accessible to consumers in green and orange zones.”Ankur Pahwa^ Partner and National Leader – E-Commerce and Consumer Internet^ EY India^ said that the demand generated by tier-II and -III cities for non-essential items will be key indicator of the consumer sentiment as many of the tier-I cities continue to be under mixed zone. “Start-ups in the mobility space will especially hope to quickly get back to normal although with more stringent hygiene measures in place and some of the guidelines provide tail wind to them^ while B2C companies will have to wait for the demand to pick up under the discretionary spends^” he added. Meanwhile^ consumer products firms and their sellers are working to begin selling their inventories in green and orange zones through e-commerce.Harkirat Singh^ MD^ Aero Club known for brand Woodland^ said^ “We have begun talks with Myntra and Flipkart in this regard. We will need to monitor how demand pans out in the next few days.”Added Avneet Singh Marwah^ Director & CEO^ Super Plastronics Pvt. Ltd^ “We are going to start online sales from tomorrow in orange and green zones. But majority of online sales still come from urban centres which are currently in red zones.”,04,05
2020-05-02,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/stock-fundamental-analysis-india/hul-q4-results-why-the-road-to-recovery-looks-longer/article31488750.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,HUL Q4 results: Why the road to recovery looks longer,For 15 days of disruption^ Hindustan Unilever has had quite a bit to worry about in the quarter ended March 2020 — with volumes plunging 7 per cent over the March 2019 quarter (year-on-year)^ sales shrinking almost 10 per cent to ₹8^885 crore and profits dropping by 1 per cent to ₹1^519 crore.With a complete lockdown in April and only a partial return to normalcy expected in the near term^ the company may continue to be on a rough terrain^ even as it operates in the ‘defensive’ consumer non-durables (FMCG) space^ supplying essentials. HUL’s March 2020 quarter results also foretell what may be in store from other players in this segment.As it is^ private consumption had been in slowdown mode even before the Covid-19-led distruption.Going by HUL’s numbers^ the road to consumption recovery has only become longer.New low in volumesThe Covid-19 pandemic set in at a time when the FMCG industry itself was seeing a slowdown in volumes. Nielsen estimates show that after growing at 13.5 per cent each in 2017 and 2018^ the industry growth slowed progressively through each of the quarters of 2019. Thus^ although the overall growth for 2019 stood at 9.2 per cent^ growth had actually come down to 6.5 per cent by the October-December 2019 quarter.This further deteriorated to 5.3 per cent in the three months ended March 2020.The weakening in HUL’s volume growth over the past few quarters is in line with this.HUL’s volume growth (year-on-year) plunged to 5-7 per cent in each of the quarters of 2019^ compared with the 10-12 per cent growth seen in the five quarters prior to that. The 7 per cent drop seen now is the lowest in recent memory. Despite the impact of demonetisation in the three months ended December 2016^ HUL had seen a volume drop of only 4 per cent. In the GST transition during the quarter ended June 2017^ the company saw 0 per cent (flat) volume growth.As against a 7 per cent fall in volumes in the March 2020 quarter^ revenues dipped by 9.4 per cent. This is almost a 12 per cent drop from the 3 per cent growth that HUL had expected^ if it was business as usual.HUL attributes half of this fall to reduction in distributor stocks^ and the remaining to reduction in retailer stocks and shrinkage in consumer demand.The top line was also impacted due to 15 per cent price cuts made in hand wash (Lifebuoy) and home cleaners (Domex). Price cuts in hand sanitisers^ due to classification as essential commodity^ were also put in place.Margin pressureApart from weak volumes and price cuts^ higher raw material prices and advertising expenses exerted pressure on margins.Raw material costs as a percentage of sales moved up to 49.4 per cent from 46.9 per cent a year ago. Although crude prices fell^ the company saw cost escalations in inputs such as other oils^ skimmed milk powder and tomato paste.Advertising expenses as a percentage of sales stood at 13.1 per cent vis-à-vis 11.3 per cent.As a result^ operating margins dropped 40 basis points to 22.9 per cent over the March 2019 quarter (160 basis points drop on comparable basis due to Ind AS 116 adjustments).In the next one or two quarters^ a comeback in margins may not be easy. For one^ beauty and personal care^ the company’s biggest and most profitable segment^ is riding on the back seat now. Sales in this segment plunged 14 per cent in the March 2020 quarter^ compared with a 4-6 per cent drop in the home care and foods segment^ while margins also dropped to 24.8 per cent from 27.7 per cent a year ago. It is notable that this segment was already impacted by the consumption slowdown seen even before the Covid-19 outbreak.The focus on producing and selling essential goods such as hygiene/home care products and foods^ and limited room for price increases could continue to exert pressure on margins.The emphasis on getting goods to selling/distribution points through third-party partners (Swiggy^ Dunzo^ HumaraShop) during the lockdown may also impact margins.However^ the company has taken a few measures to mitigate the pain points to an extent.It is striving to improve its product mix by bringing out new hygiene products such as Lifebuoy/Domex germ kill spray^ cloth sanitisers and germ removal wipes. Thanks to the merger with GSK Consumer Healthcare^ the company is also pushing nutrition drinks such as Horlicks during this time. Horlicks with added zinc^ which supposedly boosts immunity^ is already being supplied.Secondly^ cost-cutting efforts are also on^ with focus on receivables^ inventory management^ deployment of credit^ pruning advertising expenses^ trimming travel spends and deferring some expansion plans.OutlookFor most FMCG compies^ the past few quarters have been characterised by rural demand falling sharply behind urban offtakes.So far^ rural India seems to be less impacted by Covid-19. This presents a window of opportunity for HUL^ which usually derives 40-45 per cent of its revenues from rural India.However^ according to HUL^ rural demand is dependent on factors such as migrants sending back money home^ the extent to which direct transfer benefits have reached rural population^ as well as the extent to which harvesting and transportation of produce to mandis has been carried out. Hence it is too early to say that rural demand could cushion the urban slowdown.The restoration of supplies to the extent of 75-80 per cent as of end-April — be it in terms of raw materials or delivery to distributors — is a positive for the company. Production lines^ though^ have not come back to normal yet. The production of hand sanitisers has gone up 60 times over the average of the December 2019 quarter.On the other hand^ the company re-started manufacturing skin and hair care products recently^ and has also got approvals to commence production of beauty and personal care products. Ice-cream production is negligible^ despite the scorching sun.The company is currently not in a position to judge pent-up demand for various products due to the lockdown^ and hence^ production-demand mismatch in the near term could occur.Synergy benefits from the merger of GSK Consumer will be a factor to watch out for in the coming quarters.While the uncertainty continues^ the HUL stock hit a one-year high of ₹2^614 in early April^ buoyed by relative resilience of consumer non-durables to an economic slowdown^ the completion of merger of GSK Consumer^ and the acquisition of VWash from Glenmark Pharmaceuticals.

2020-05-02,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/indias-lockdown-is-running-up-an-unsustainable-economic-cost/article31483726.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,India’s lockdown is running up an unsustainable economic cost,The Centre’s decision to further extend the lockdown by two weeks may or may not flatten the Covid-19 infection curve^ but will certainly decimate India’s growth curve. In a sign of things to come^ India’s eight core sector industries^ which account for a weight of 40 per cent in the Index of Industrial Production^ contracted by 6.5 per cent in March. Steel and electricity output fell by 13 per cent and 7 per cent^ respectively^ while cement^ natural gas and fertiliser production fell 25 per cent^ 15 per cent and 12 per cent^ respectively. Meanwhile^ power consumption fell 9.2 per cent in March^ due to lower commercial and industrial demand in the wake of the lockdown^ according to the National Load Dispatch Centre data. India’s drop in energy consumption mirrors global trends; according to the International Energy Agency^ global energy demand fell 3.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2020 over the same period in 2019. The IEA observes: “If lockdowns last for many months and recoveries are slow across much of the world^ as is increasingly likely^ annual energy demand will drop by 6 per cent in 2020^ wiping off the last five years of demand growth. Such a decline has not been seen for the past 70 years.” Given the perception that the pandemic is likely to be around for another two years^ most countries are bound to set aside lockdowns as a strategy to contain the virus. India cannot afford to be different^ given the crippling impact of the lockdown on businesses and workers.Leading lights of India Inc have expressed their dismay over the prevailing situation. Auto sector sales were virtually zero in April. A long-term strategy to keep the economy running^ while combating the virus^ must be worked out: one that focusses on intensifying testing and possibly curbs on the vulnerable population^ while allowing the rest to resume economic activity with the necessary precautions.On Friday^ the Centre issued a detailed list of ‘red’^ ‘orange’ and ‘green’ zones^ with a view to relaxing curbs on the ‘green’ and ‘orange’ areas. However^ geographical containment may not spur economic activity^ given the interlinkages across regions^ of materials and people. There may be no point in opening up manufacturing without freeing retail. Economic revival can be led by sectors that employ large numbers across the value chain and work on low inventories^ such as food processing^ other FMCG products and perhaps electronic goods. Construction can be revived with safeguards. But for this thrust to work^ a fiscal stimulus is a must. The Centre needs to act. Now.,02,05

Despite manufacturing and selling essential products^ in this lockdown period^ FMCG companies have had to swiftly respond to unprecedented challenges^ with innovative strategies to maintain supply chains and ensure consumers can access their products.Mohit Anand^ Managing Director^ Kellogg South Asia said^ ""We started navigating these precarious times effectively by making a rapid business resumption plan^ with uncompromising focus on people safety. Our first order of business was to put together a ""crack"" team comprising representatives from our supply chain^ sales^ regulatory and legal functions and executing with a ‘hyper-local’ approach to restore our supply chain and distribution.""Anand said the company worked closely with Central^ State and district level authorities and industry associations^ to secure permissions to re-start its manufacturing units and overcoming supply chain disruptions by ""re-starting warehouse and distribution operations^ town by town^ city by city^ State by State.""Last mile deliveryFrom implementing strategies to scale-up or re-start operations at plants and warehouses^ to striking unique online and offline partnerships for last mile deliveries^ FMCG companies have had to pull out all the stops to stay resilient.Parveen Dalal^ Sales Director^ Mondelez India said^ ""Our utmost priority is to build a resilient system that will enable us to maintain good service levels across channels.We are working directly with hypermarkets to negate any possible time lag or safety risks for the consumers. While e-commerce continues to be an important part of our network layout^ by modelling strategies like direct store deliveries^ customer backhauls and fostering partnerships with tech-enabled delivery platforms like Swiggy^ Scootsy^ Delhivery^ Dunzo^ we are consolidating our circuit to reach retailers and consumers."" In partnership with Near.Store^ the company has begun residential deliveries to 70 housing societies in Mumbai^ which will be extended to other cities.Besides enhancing existing e-commerce partnerships^ MTR Foods has also tied up with Swiggy^ Zomato and even Cure.fit. Sunay Bhasin^ CMO^ MTR Foods Pvt. Ltd said^ ""We have also tied up with Shell to ensure our products are available across their petrol pumps in South India. We have also enhanced direct deliveries of orders placed through our own website to nearly 15^000 pincodes during the lockdown.”The focus has not just been on enhancing B2C deliveries but also on efficient B2B deliveries to distributors and retailers. Sanjay Mishra^ COO-India Sales and Bangladesh Business^ Marico Ltd said^ ""We have partnered with national players like Delhivery^ Shadowfax and Lalamove to ensure products are delivered from factories to depots and thereafter to distributors. Additionally^ the services of these logistics partners have been extended to the distributors so as to ensure movement of goods to the final retailers."" Besides last mile delivery tie-ups with e-commerce partners^ Marico has also commenced tele-servicing and introduced an app for retailers.Will these innovative strategies remain a stop-gap arrangement or become long-term strategies? Pinakiranjan Mishra^ Partner and Leader^ Consumer Products and Retail^ EY India said^ “FMCG companies will become more active in their direct to consumer outreach as this crisis will have a long-term impact on consumer behaviour and they will need to devise strategies to adjust to this new reality. Recent trends such as the outreach to various resident welfare associations and tie-ups with e-commerce for last mile delivery are examples of how companies are quickly adopting to the external environment^ the changing consumer need and behaviour and thus^ looking to turn it into long-term^ sustainable business strategies.”",01,05

Red covers areas where Covid-19 cases are increasing^ orange includes areas where patients have been diagnosed but the numbers are not rising^ and green is where there are no patients. The State has already allowed some industrial activity in orange and green zones^ with restrictions and precautions.Thackeray’s statement essentially means that industries located in the Mumbai Pune-Aurangabad and Nagpur belt^ including automobile^ ESDM (electronic system and design manufacturing)^ pharmaceuticals and chemicals^ engineering^ FMCG and IT/ITeS might have to wait for further directions from the State government for full-fledged operations.Impact on Pune IT sectorThe IT/ITeS sector in the Pune region might take time to resume operations. From 2014 to 2018^ 119 private IT parks with an investment of approximately ₹19^260 crore and employment of 5^50^000 have come up in the State.“We are working from home as of now. But the fear of job loss is looming large. No salary cuts as of now^ but some companies have put a freeze on hiring^” said an employee with an IT firm in Pune.The majority of MSMEs are located in the Pune-Mumbai-Aurangabad belt. MSMEs account for more than 80 per cent of the total employment^ according to the State government’s latest industrial policy. The policy adds that MSMEs are best placed to utilise local resources and create local entrepreneurship and employment. About 40 per cent of the exports originate from such units.The Pune region^ one of India’s largest auto hubs^ houses Tata Motors^ Mahindra & Mahindra and Bajaj Auto apart from international majors such as Volkswagen and Mercedes.Industry players say the majority of skilled and unskilled workers here — from Bihar^ Jharkhand^ Odisha^ Assam and Uttar Pradesh — have headed home following the virus outbreak and it would not be possible to restart operations till they return.,01,05

IIT-Madras-incubated start-ups Fabheads Automation and Axis Defence Labs have come up with 3D-printed personal protection equipment (PPE) and face shields made using simple stationery materials.Tech Plaastic Industrie Pvt Ltd^ which makes injection and thermoset injection moulded components for various industries including automotive^ has developed a hands-free sanitiser dispensing machine. This was developed primarily for internal use as the company^ whose plant is in Irungattukottai to the west of Chennai^ had received special permission to open the unit to maintain the machines and moulds. It had to ensure that the workers involved in the work were safe and adopted prescribed practices.Cost-savingsAccording to MP Shankar^ Director – Operations^ Tech Plaastic^ the cost of doing business is going to increase once the lockdown is lifted^ as enterprises will have to follow stringent hygiene guidelines. To mitigate the cost of investment^ the company decided to form teams and focus on frugal engineering. The objective^ he said^ was to avoid the use of hands for operating the sanitiser dispenser. There had to be no water wastage^ the equipment had to be easy to maintain and the target price was ₹5^000 or less.The team^ he said^ had seen pneumatic operated dispensers^ mechanical dispensers with a number of moving parts. These would cost a lot. Tech Plaastic’s engineers have come up with a product made entirely out of scrap material at the company^ which dispenses sanitisers with the press of a pedal with the foot. This has been placed at the entrance of the plant and whenever a worker walks in^ he has to clean his hands with the sanitiser^ after which his temperature is recorded.Shankar said the company did not have immediate plans to make this product commercially^ but had been getting positive feedback from its customers^ who were interested in placing orders. If it decided to go for a commercial launch of the product^ Tech Plaastic^ Shankar said^ would need a team of designers and one for manufacturing.The key to success was product design — it had to be simple to use^ manufacture^ ship and assemble on site. The company would require four weeks to convert the prototype into a commercially viable product and would need three months to get the manufacturing systems in place. “The key is to keep the price at ₹5^000 or lower^” said Shankar.No-touch soap dispenserAnother company^ Sreevatsa Stainless Steel Fabrication (P) Ltd^ which specialises in architectural applications of stainless steel for buildings and the construction sector^ has come up with a no-touch soap and water dispenser^ made of stainless steel.According to CS Srivathsan^ Director^ Sreevatsa Stainless Steel^ the team designed the dispenser in a day and supplied one to the Corporation of Chennai. You press a pedal^ the soap dispenser squirts out just the right quantity of soap to clean your hand^ while in another bay^ the foot-operated water dispenser provides enough water to wash off the soap. The dispensing units can have one or two soap and water dispensing points^ depending on what the customer wants.Sreevatsa Stainless Steel had supplied a few units to the Chennai Corporation^ after which it received orders from the Avadi Corporation. Each unit would cost about ₹45^000^ but can be made at about ₹28^000 excluding taxes and transportation^ if lower grade stainless steel was used^ he said. One of these dispensing units had been installed at Ripon Buildings^ the Chennai Corporation’s headquarters^ for use by the public. The soap dispenser had to be refilled 6-7 times a day and the unit was working satisfactorily^ he added.Srivathsan said the machine would find application in hospitals^ hotels^ restaurants^ IT offices and educational institutions. “We are looking at it as a solution which can meet all requirements for personal hygiene in a post-pandemic world^” he said.As the cliché goes^ necessity is the mother of invention.,30,04

The economy of Maharashtra is mainly driven by manufacturing^ finance^ international trade^ technology^ petroleum^ fashion^ apparel^ gems and jewellery^ IT & ITeS^ and tourism.The industrial ecosystem in the state for various industries including automobile^ ESDM^ pharmaceuticals and chemicals^ engineering^ FMCG^ textile^ food processing^ logistics^ cement and the steel industry and IT & ITeS are at a standstill because of the lockdown.According to reports^ about 4^500 industries have resumed operations with the government’s permission and following all norms. However^ majority of them are unwilling to re-start operations and are waiting for clear directions from the government after May 3. As of now^ about 96^000 workers have joined work^ according to reports.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar in a social media interaction on Thursday said that along with the Covid-19 crisis the State is also facing a huge economic crisis. He added that concrete steps must be taken so that industries^ businesses^ and agriculture works restart in the state.“There is an expected revenue shortfall of ₹1.4-lakh crore^ that is^ 40 per cent of the State’s annual budget revenue estimates. The financial fabric of the state stands completely disturbed. There would be more job losses and unemployment will rise^” said Pawar. He insisted that it was high time for the Centre and State to ensure the industry and business cycle is smoothly back on track.Arun Firodia^ Chairman of Kinetic Group has said that geographical relaxation of lockdown is not practical because the supply chain is across various states^ districts^ and zones. Firodia suggested that it would be better to relax it sector by sector and industry by industry.“We should insist that all the components of the supply chain must adhere to testing / social distancing norms and all employees in the supply chain stay on site. Migrant workers should be invited back and tested before they are allowed to resume duties. A timetable for opening the various sectors should be announced so that sectors/ industries can start planning and organising which itself will take two weeks in each sector/industry^” he said.Firodia added^ “That will allow migrant workers to plan their return and industries can give schedules to their vendors and dealer showrooms can open. Even in hot spots^ industries could be asked to operate if the employees are allowed to stay on premises and give them time to make arrangements. I think^ most of the industry is not expecting to go full swing from day one.”,30,04

It had earlier predicted growth to be in the range of 9-10 per cent for India's FMCG sector for the full year of 2020.The research and insights firm^ which follows the January-December period as a fiscal year^ pointed to macro-economic conditions such as lower GDP growth rate predictions^ rising unemployment levels especially in rural region as well as the severe impact on economic activity across sectors and supply chains^ due to the Covid-19 pandemic^ as key reasons for this forecast.It also said that the intensity^ severity and longevity of the lockdown would have significant implications for multiple industries^ including FMCG industry^ which had begun witnessing signs of revival in the first two months of the year.

However^ a recent survey conducted by FabHotels^ among more than 500 industry leaders managing travel within their organizations^ states that business travel is likely to bounce back sooner than most people expect.According to the survey titled ‘State of business travel post-Covid-19’ taken by over 500 respondents^ 80 per cent respondents expect the business travel to resume to pre-Covid levels in their organization with 6 months post lockdown.India’s hotel market is more than $10 billion in size. The global pandemic is expected to leave corporate businesses with less money to spend on travel^ lodging^ and entertainment. The survey by one of the leading hospitality chains^ which was conducted among its leading corporate partners found that 58 per cent of corporates expect a reduction of 15 per cent or more in the travel budget. 19 per cent expect a reduction of less than 15 per cent^ while 24 per cent corporates expect travel budgets to remain the same post the lockdown is lifted.While one-third of respondents said they would not move employees to lower-tier hotels to save expenses^ the other two-thirds said they are expected to make this transition to reduce their travel budgets.This survey covered companies across sectors ranging from IT to Pharmaceuticals^ and IT to FMCG. Nearly half of the respondents in this survey had employee strength of more than 500 permanent employees. More than 10 per cent of employees travel more than once a month at 45 per cent surveyed organizations. Not surprisingly^ hygiene and sanitization at the hotels are going to become extremely critical in the decision-making process of corporates. A very high 93 per cent of respondents said they are likely to switch from unbranded to branded hotels post lockdown for better hygiene and sanitization requirements for their employees. 88.4 per cent respondents said they are likely to revaluate their budget hotel partnerships post lockdown.Commenting on the survey results^ spokesperson of FabHotels^ Mr. Vaibhav Aggarwal^ Founder & CEO stated in the official release: “FabHotels has been at forefront of understanding and fulfilling requirements of business travelers pan-India. Our partnerships with some of the largest enterprises are a testimony to that. We feel delighted that even in this grim environment^ our enterprise partners are upbeat about a swift recovery in business travel at their organizations. Post lockdown^ we once again intend to serve our customers in the best manner possible by providing industry-leading hygiene and sanitisation standards.”,29,04

The outflow is twice the ₹10^113 crore that FPIs pulled out in FY19.“Cross-currency headwinds^ muted outlook by managements^ slowing BFSI spend due to a potentially weaker macro in developed markets...and regulatory hindrances by developed economies meant that software stocks seemed fairly valued in the background of slowing topline growth and expected squeeze on margins^” said Deepak Jasani^ Head of Research^ HDFC Securities.Earlier this month^ technology research and advisory firm Information Services Group (ISG) lowered its forecast for global deal activity this year on account of the pandemic. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said ISG’s statement implies a 10 per cent decline in global deal activity in 2020^ with the fall being more pronounced in the end of the June quarter.Liquidity crunchFPI sell-off in the Food^ Beverages & Tobacco sector was even sharper. The sector witnessed a net outflow of ₹14^055 crore in FY20^ nearly eight times the ₹1^980 crore in FY19.“The general slowdown in the FMCG and retail space in the given year can be attributed to the liquidity crunch faced by the entire economy post the IL&FS crisis^” said Nirali Shah^ Senior Research Analyst^ Samco Securities. “ITC alone witnessed a reduction of 2.1 per cent in FPI from the June quarter of 2019 to the March quarter of 2020.”Surprisingly^ the Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology sector^ which was among the top five gainers under the equity category in FY19^ ended up losing a net of ₹11^200 crore in FY20. “The crippling structures being imposed by the USFDA put pressure on Indian pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies^ which led to the extreme outflow from FPIs^” Shah said.“However^ things seem to be normalised in this sector and this year could be a turnaround with more inflows than outflows by foreign investors^” she added.Outflow in MarchAs the number of Covid-19 cases spiked in India^ FPI sell-off also witnessed a record monthly outflow in March. FPIs pulled out ₹61^973 crore from equities and ₹60^376 crore from debt that month. In the Financial sector^ which includes banks and NBFCs^ equities faced the wrath of this massive outflow^ losing ₹20^000 crore^ or 32 per cent of the total amount pulled out by the FPIs.However^ foreign investors continue to pour money into the Indian listed insurance space. The sector was a big gainer of FPI inflows^ with a net receipt of ₹27^500 crore in FY20. The other gainers in the previous fiscal include Media (₹6^627 crore)^ retailing (₹3^605 crore)^ Oil & Gas (₹3^037 crore) and Coal (₹1^900 crore).“Insurance is a comparatively newer category which came out with a number of IPOs only from 2017. Since then this space has gained momentum because of the evergreen streams of revenue and its under-penetrated nature along with high regulatory entry barriers^” Samco Securities’ Shah said.“Investors are huddling to get a piece of this massive growth driver to India’s future^” she added.,29,04

Entity-level risk mapping involves risk categorization in terms of most vulnerable^ moderately vulnerable and relatively less vulnerable entities; here too^ the review of the first two categories is being prioritized.It has categorised automobile OEMS and auto-ancillaries^ construction^ consumer durables and power as medium risk sectors and said they face relatively lower degree of business disruptions and credit risks. “Further^ the after effects of Covid-19 crisis on these sectors may not persist for long^” it said.The low risk sectors like agri-products^ education^ FMCG^ telecom are unlikely to face material business disruption^ or a material increase in credit risks over the near term^ triggered solely by the Covid-19 crisis^ it further noted.“Subsequent to our 2019-20 ratings action^ the current Covid-19 pandemic triggered crisis has led to a widespread deterioration in the credit quality of India Inc.

When factories and businesses re-start post lifting of the lockdown^ companies will need access to a skilled pipeline of workers.Lohit Bhatia^ President^ Indian Staffing Federation (ISF)^ told BusinessLine^ “The cost to replace^ rebuild and reskill workers will be more expensive for employers^ after the Covid-19 slowdown. It is imperative that companies continue with their current staff to help them achieve results later and assist in the rebuild period.”“Each employee has an attached cost of mobilisation^ induction^ training and getting them upto speed with performance. Letting go of them just before the rebuild period will mean companies will have to reinvent the entire cycle of hiring^ skilling and economic activity^” Bhatia said.He said most market leaders will refrain from this as the “restart and rebuild period can further get elongated impacting possible revenues that can be earned then”.Covid-19 has impacted each and every segment of the economy and employability^ said Bhatia adding the pandemic has created doubts in the minds of employees and employers alike^ about the duration and extent of the lockdown.“One needs to look at data from countries like China where it was almost fully resolved (but has restarted with vigour) and South Korea^ where the graph is declining and the number of recoveries exceed the number of new cases each day. Similarly^ countries which were epicentre earlier^ like Italy and Spain^ now report almost half of the daily cases as compared to the past few weeks. This goes to show India will exit this crises in a few weeks^” he added.It is at that time “once the health emergency is over” when economies get back on their feet that they will have to rely on their workers.Bhatia said most of the companies in India have a consolidated situation on overall employment^ whether its core (permanent employment) or temp employment or staffing employment. “Many corporates and global multinationals have paid salaries in the month of March^ much ahead of the scheduled timeline^ and supported employees in this time of crises. Similarly^ many corporates and industry leaders have assured staff (both permanent and temporary) that they are going to ensure stability and continuity of wages^” he added.The official said: “corporates across India are using their heart with head while taking decisions. Most are looking at the human aspect as much as the financial and P&L aspect. But these measures need to be implemented across sectors.”The recent MHA directive^ restarting companies in a calibrated way post April 20^ was termed a good step by the official^ as it is a transition for full opening up. “Industries that are allowed to function at this time^ like food services^ groceries^ FMCG^ e-commerce and delivery companies^ can redeploy their workers to avail of the new demand that pours in^” he said.ISF representationBhatia^ who is also president of Quess Corp^ a technology and business services provider^ said employment Acts in India prohibit massive layoffs. “Under the Disaster Management Act the Union of India has made it non-compliant to lay off workers during a lockdown and ensure continuity of wages^ and more importantly^ continuity of social security and insurance. The IFS has proactively shared some suggestions with the government to assist employers during the rebuild period^” he added.In its representation to the government^ IFS has suggested certain steps that are non cash/non subsidy based^ which will assist employers during the rebuild period to reduce their employment cost. “This can be done without taking any assistance from the central or state government and treasury^” said Bhatia.He added if these suggestions are implemented^ it will go a long way in assisting employers tide over the current period as well as the financial year^ and ensure companies continue with wages as well as their employees.,27,04

Paytm plans to scale it to more cities within the next few weeks.Paytm said that it has launched several initiatives to help stressed businesses including its merchant partners^ small shop owners^ SMEs during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis.Paytm claimed that it has digitally-enabled small businesses and helped them sell their products on Paytm Mall. Paytm said that it has given the stores all the necessary logistics support. The company hopes to help shops and stores which have either witnessed a sharp decline in footfall or had to abruptly pause operations due to the lockdown.Many of the stores^ while they have the inventory^ are running short on the workforce as many of their employees have returned to their hometowns. Paytm Mall said it is connecting the offline stores with their logistics partners so that they can deliver to their customers and keep their businesses running. The company said that grocery store owners are witnessing almost 50 per cent additional orders per day.Srinivas Mothey^ Senior Vice President^ Paytm Mall stated in the official release: ""Paytm Mall has always advocated a 100 per cent marketplace model of operation against an inventory led one as pursued by other major players.

The searches mainly were in the healthcare^ ed-tech^ and remote working sectors. A survey conducted by the portal^ in February^ revealed that people have shown greater interest about working in healthcare. “The number of job searches for this sector has seen an increase of 5 per cent on a year-on-year basis^” said Sashi Kumar^ Managing Director^ Indeed India.Analysis by AscentHR and Genius Consultants Ltd showed that e-commerce is another area where jobs are available. Amazon^ Grofers and BigBasket recently made announcements to ramp up hiring.Lohit Bhatia^ President of Workforce Management^ Quess Corp Limited^ said^ “Remote interviews are happening for key skills personnel in e-commerce^ IT services^ and captive IT organisations.”Pallavi Tyagi^ CHRO^ at Capgemini India^ said the IT major has already hired 6^000 employees for this quarter. For Q2^ offers have been rolled out for more than 4^000 lateral hires.“Manufacturing is also likely to show demand as factories re-open gradually^ though a bit of support from the Government can go a long way to assist the same quickly^” said Bhatia.Rahul Sinha^ President-HR^ Pidilite Industries Ltd^ said that while the company will “have to be nimble-footed and adapt as the situation evolves^” its hiring is “largely in frontline employees.”With most companies across the world mandating work from home (WFH)^ AscentHR and Genius Consultants have seen high demand from cloud and PaaS (platform as a service) companies.According to Manpower Group^ many companies are offering employees an opportunity to upskill themselves by taking up online courses along with organising seminars and workshops to ensure employees feel valued.Indeed India’s analysis shows that job postings for online tutoring and e-learning have seen an increase of 3 per cent between January and March 2020. “This could be a consequence of the shift to online classes^ expedited by the current Covid-19 lockdown^” said Kumar.He explained that a surge of 71 per cent between 2017 and 2020 has been recorded in job postings for online tutoring and e-learning. This^ according to him^ could be attributed to the advancement of digital media^ which has opened newer avenues to roles such as online tutors and e-educators. “The number of job postings for these roles has seen an increase of 8 per cent in the last one year (2019-20)” he said.“Job seekers are increasingly searching for terms like ‘remote’^ ‘work from home’ and related phrases^” said Kumar.

He says if an investor does not make a beginning in the market now^ waiting for the bottom^ the probability of him/her capturing the bottom^ going ahead^ is low.Do you think the worst in the stock markets is over? What is your outlook?I think the worst is behind us. On the back of prompt and decisive actions taken by central banks around the world^ the volatility in the markets is down. We will not go back to the worst wes aw in March unless there is a panic situation emerging. Markets have recovered from the previous immediate lows by about 20 per cent^ both globally and in India.It will be range-bound for a while and the upside will depend on incremental data^ especially related to the virus and also how economies^ including India^ will emerge from the lockdown. I think it will take another one year or so to see earlier peak levels. By that time^ hopefully^ the lost earnings will be recouped.What is your view on market valuations now? Is it a good time to invest in mid- and small-cap stocks?I think the market was punished heavily due to potential loss of earnings. FY21 earnings were expected to grow by about 15 per cent^ but after Covid-19^ earnings growth could be zero or even negative. Let us assume the earnings fall by 5 per cent in FY21. It will be a negative surprise of 20 per cent (15%+5%) compared with earlier.The market should have been lower by 20 per cent versus what we were at that time.But today the market is down by about 25 per cent from its peak.Thus^ some bit of run-up and normalisation is likely.The mid- and small-cap stocks are now trading at about 10 per cent discount to Nifty. Historically^ they have traded at about a 15 per cent discount to the large-cap index. We can expect mid- and small-caps to perform better than large-caps.Post-Covid-19^ will lower valuations be the new normal?I don’t think so. We currently have a crisis^ but there was a crisis earlier as well. Markets fell steeply and have now gone to the other end of the pendulum.Swings toward the extremes of the pendulum keep happening.Once things fall into place and we get a better economic outlook^ markets will probably be on the positive end of the pendulum.We should regain our lost premium on valuation once the outlook becomes clear.What domestic sectors presently offer opportunities to invest?As and when things settle down^ there will be decent value in a few stocks in banking and financial services^ but caution should be exercised. Similarly^ the consumer discretionary segment has also become quite attractive.How it emerges will be a function of how the situation will be after the lockdown. Defensive sectors such as FMCG^ some part of services and utilities such as telecom^ utilities^ pharma and technology are a few we look at to maintain balance in the portfolio.What investing theme should one look at — value or growth?Now^ there is no much difference between both. Value is offered across the board. Some growth stocks are available at reasonable valuations. The difference is that^ when things settle down^ and the economic outlook looks a little more positive^ the return on stock picks^ value strategy or contra strategy may be slightly better than the growth strategy.What are the top metrics an investor should look at before investing now?An investor should be very clear about the kind of liquidity available to him for some time going forward. Investors who are tight on liquidity now should not enter the market^ or they should reassess. Secondly^ an investor has to know their risk profile.If he/she has a medium risk appetite^ he/she should follow a medium risk strategy and that too amulti-cap strategy.And next^ an investor now need not necessarily wait for the market to bottom or a fall by 20-30 per cent. It is a good time to start investing; it may not be the best time^ but it is certainly one of the better times to start investing.,26,04

The FMCG major has 120 manufacturing locations in the country^ which include third-party plants.The company also believes that restarting of the entire manufacturing and agri value chains^ outside the containment zones^ would be important to kick-start economic activity^ as the country grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic.Speaking to reporters on Thursday^ Sanjiv Puri^ Chairman and Managing Director^ ITC^ said^ “The government has been very proactive in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. But as we understand from experts^ this fight against Covid-19 will be long and there are economic costs associated with the lockdown. As the Prime Minister sometime back said^ we have to look at both lives and livelihoods. So in this temporary new normal^ economic activity has to also start^ as we deal with the issue of livelihoods.”“The government’s notifications have given broader relaxation for economic activity outside containment zones and the focus has been on getting manufacturing revived. Getting the entire manufacturing value chains to operate end-to-end^ which also includes distribution and transportation of the products and getting the agri-value chain functional^ will be key. Also^ whatever is getting manufactured needs to reach the end consumer^” he added.Puri said that it’s the collective responsibility of the stakeholders to follow the protocols of safety and hygiene. The company believes additional clarifications are needed in terms of manufacturing operation norms in urban regions.For ITC^ the key focus^ during the ongoing challenging times^ has been to maintain and enhance the supply of essential items by operating factories^ distribution points^ as well as agri buying points^ to cater to the surge in demand of essential products like staple and hygiene products.“Capacity utilisation is in the range of 20-60 per cent depending on each location. We are mainly producing items that have immediate visibility of demand. At this time^ the focus is to conserve cash and streamline costs^” Puri added.Revival strategiesAt the same time^ the company is working on revival strategies and plans to bounce back stronger. “We do believe the current crisis will pass and the focus is on how to bounce back much more stronger and take advantage of some of the emerging opportunities. We also need to look at redesigning some of our services. We are going through a difficult patch where there will be a severe impact on the economy. But the long-term fundamentals of the Indian economy are intact^” Puri said^ adding that the focus has to be on adaptability and agility for business continuity.The company has also been focusing on fast-tracking innovations such as the launch of Savlon Surface disinfectant spray^ which was done in a matter of four weeks or re-purposing its perfume factory to enhance production capacity of Savlon sanitisers.Asked about recovery in the economy^ Puri said^ “It all depends on economic activity revival. How much of economic activity is revived...would really determine the extent of the impact. The impact appears to be quite substantive in the first quarter.”Replying to a query on major shifts in consumer behaviour^ Puri said^ “Based on early signs that we have picked^ there is a big consumer shift towards health and wellness and hygiene products. Consumers are increasingly looking for products that they can trust and so strong brands will be very important in future. We are also focussing on purposeful digital engagement with consumers as digital adoption is moving ahead at an accelerated pace.”Given that economic activities have come down to very low levels^ the issues of lives and livelihoods remain the key concerns and facilitation will be required from the government to get manufacturing in areas outside the containment zones to reasonable capacity levels^ believes Puri.A long lockdown means more stress on economic activities and more support from the government will be required. “It is directly correlated^” Puri said^ adding that there will be companies^ especially MSMEs^ who will face liquidity crunch; at the same time sectors such as hotels and airlines will also require capital support.,24,04

This will help such companies reach out faster to market places.Ramping upEveready^ the country's largest dry cell battery-maker^ said it has already received permission for operations at its manufacturing facilities in Lucknow^ Hardwar and Matia^ subject to certain guidelines inclusive of maintaining a minimum number of people.While the Lucknow and Hardwar facilities are “partially operational” in a gradual and phased manner^ “the manufacturing facility at Matia (Assam) would be partially operational in a few days^” it said in a notice to the bourses.ITC has ramped up production across 100 factories. “We have ramped up production across 100 factories which are now operational with the highest protocols of hygiene and safety. With the help of State authorities and local communities around our factories^ we have been manufacturing essential items and progressively endeavouring to service growing demand^” an ITC spokesperson said.Dabur India said all its factories were operational. According to Shahrukh Khan^ Executive Director –Operations^ the company is now trying to maximise production given the supply chain constraints^ and material and manpower availability.“Almost all of Dabur’s factories are operational today^ producing a range of Ayurvedic medicines^ hygiene products such as hand sanitisers^ hand wash and daily essentials^ with strict implementation of SOPs for social distancing at offices^ workplace^ factories^ proper sanitisation of buildings^ factories^ etc^” he said.Supply issuesKhan pointed out that the forced closure of some factories of “suppliers and their suppliers” (referring to the supply chain) – mainly the MSMEs – for key products like hand sanitisers^ as they fall within the hot spot radius^ is affecting smooth functioning.“It is our request that companies that do not have any instances of Covid cases may be permitted to operate even if they fall within the radius of a hot spot^ provided they adopt and implement all safety protocols and screening measures^ and follow social distancing norms. This would ease the pressure on the supply chain^” he added.Similarly^ easing of restrictions^ particularly in the agricultural sector and transportation^ should help in streamlining the supply chain. It will “progressively prepare for a recovery stage^” the ITC spokesperson said.,22,04

These extraordinary^ unprecedented and disruptive times call upon us to do different things^ differently^ thereby presenting us a unique opportunity to strengthen our personal brands.How is a personal brand formed?When people interact^ they gather impressions about each other in terms of their expertise^ creativity^ communication skills and general demeanour. The collage that emerges from a combination of these impressions represents a person’s brand. A brand is the identity or the reputation that one enjoys in the minds of one’s stakeholders.Think out of the boxThe idea of making a short film with a strong ‘social distancing’ message had struck ad filmmaker Prasoon Pandey the day the lockdown was announced. Thinking out of the box^ he came up with a novel approach for shooting the film without having anyone move out of their homes. Springing into action^ he got his son to shoot a template of the film where he played all the characters himself. This template was then distributed to the actors — the who’s who of filmdom — to enable them to see each frame from close quarters and understand how to position themselves in a particular frame.Taking cues from the template^ the actors worked from their homes^ getting a family member to shoot their piece. The director^ the editor and the music director then collaborated virtually to stitch these pieces seamlessly together^ to the tune of music. The film^ thus made in the absence of any social contact^ was a roaring success^ receiving high acclaim. As for Pandey^ his brand was further reinforced with the labels of creativity and quick action.Stepping up to the challenge of engaging his team during the lockdown^ Rahul^ a talent management executive^ implemented some creative and fun^ virtual team engagement ideas. Starting with quick 15-minute^ daily virtual huddles discussing themes like “your fitness mantra”^ “engaging kids during lockdown”^ “your greatest lockdown learning” and weekly dress-up coffee meets to “share funny pictures”^ quizzes and online games^ Rahul got the team thoroughly engaged^ adding the element of “creativity” to his brand.Be a go-getterThe lockout call spelt doom for the annual marketing strategy offsite that had been painstakingly planned at an FMCG company. The team was resigned to postponing the event to a more opportune time. But not Nandini! A senior marketing manager^ Nandini was determined to make it happen as planned. Rallying the support of her IT team^ she sat overnight exploring virtual meeting applications and presented a detailed^ well-thought-out^ virtual offsite plan to the marketing head^ who^ sceptical initially^ gave his nod to the idea.The marketing head kicked off the meeting by setting the context to the 35-member strong team that had congregated in a virtual meeting room. After a brief discussion^ the group was divided into four cohorts^ each tasked with brainstorming and action-planning around a specific issue. The four cohorts met in four virtual breakout rooms^ getting together subsequently to present their stuff to the larger group. The meeting was a huge success. Nandini^ with no prior experience in facilitating a meeting like this^ augmented her personal brand with labels like ‘self-starter’^ ‘go-getter’ and ‘willing to experiment’.Be swift on your feetWith traditional sales channels severely curtailed as a result of the lockdown^ a digital marketing executive^ Mohini^ at a manufacturing company^ was tasked with getting an online sales platform up and running. The project entailed working with multiple partners and teams — an external technology team for designing and building the platform^ logistics partners^ the internal legal and finance teams and the teams at the depots and the factory on the supply side. The project^ which would normally take 30 days^ was in operation within 10 days. Mohini^ along with her team members^ had added swiftness^ initiative and the ‘can do’ tag to her brand.Keep your coolStretched to the brim and working on tight timelines^ Aryan^ an executive in the operations team^ had erroneously sent the rate^ instead of the pin-code file^ to an external partner. Comprehending the magnitude of the error^ his heart sank as he realised that he had committed professional hara-kiri. Steeling himself for repercussions^ he wrote an apology email to his boss^ Anubhav. But guess what? Anubhav responded saying^ “No problem. Let’s move ahead.”Job concerns^ too much or too little work and constant use of technology for communication^ coupled with domestic chores^ can be frustrating and it is easy to lose one’s cool. But^ by successfully managing his emotions^ Anubhav demonstrated his emotional intelligence^ not only catapulting a team member from being motivated to super-motivated^ but adding the tag of “Mr Cool” to his brand.So how are we conducting ourselves in these testing times? How are we contributing and how are our stakeholders experiencing us? The answers to these questions will have a bearing on how we shape our brands.The author is an executive coach^ an organisational development facilitator and founder director of Delta Learning,21,04

Such solutions are already in place in South Asian countries such as Hong Kong^ Singapore^ South Korea and Tokyo^” said Santhosh Kumar^ Vice-Chairman^ Anarock Property Consultants.“Currently^ warehouses in the leading Indian cities are largely restricted to the city peripheries and far from the larger customer base. Covid-19 has already underscored the importance of e-commerce in the ongoing lockdown. With an uncertain post-pandemic future looming over the retail sector^ retail players may now need multi-level warehouses within city limits to service cities^” he added.Besides facilitating maximum land utilisation in cities like Mumbai^ multi-storey warehousing can help companies to reduce transportation costs and improve delivery time — two keys to success for most retail businesses. With technology as an enabler^ such options can replace multiple single-storey warehouses on the city peripheries and thus save on overall operational and occupancy costs.Kumar said: “Today^ fast delivery is a crucial requirement for the seamless omni-channel strategy of e-commerce players. The fallout of the coronavirus pandemic can exceed the current lockdown and social distancing may become the new normal^ at least over the mid-term. In such a market environment^ retailers will be under pressure to secure warehousing locations close to their customer base.”He further said: “Solutions like multi-storey car parking are already firmly in place in India’s most crowded and land-starved cities. Multi-storey warehouses of five or more storeys with tech-enabled loading on every floor are the next logical move.”Top trends in warehousingEven before Covid-19 and the unique imperatives the pandemic has called forth^ structural reforms such as GST implementation and infrastructure status for the logistics sector^ coupled with the rapid growth of e-commerce^ ushered in a new growth chapter for the Indian warehousing and logistics industry. Besides e-commerce^ other sectors driving demand for warehousing include FMCG^ engineering and manufacturing^ and third-party logistics.Government impetus: Budget 2020 packed several major announcements for the warehousing sector^ including a plan to build a seamless national cold storage chain. The government also plans to create warehousing in line with Warehouse Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) norms. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) will map out and geotag warehouses and cold storages.Digital technology improving efficiencies: Like other sectors^ logistics and warehousing also leverages technology to achieve better efficiency and lower dependence on manpower. Many warehouses now use software that improves fleet management via live tracking of goods^ RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems for inventory identification^ automated pallet storage^ etc.Demand in Tier-II cities: The primary demand for warehousing is currently concentrated around top cities like Delhi NCR^ Mumbai^ Bengaluru^ Chennai and Pune. Due to its locational and distribution advantage^ Kolkata has also emerged as a warehousing and logistics hub in the east. However^ the proliferation of e-commerce in smaller cities has kick-started a growing demand for warehousing in Tier-II cities such as Jaipur^ Ludhiana^ Coimbatore^ Lucknow and Guwahati.,21,04
2020-04-20,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/covid-19-kirana-stores-hold-the-key-but-may-face-stockouts/article31389764.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Covid-19: Kirana stores hold the key^ but may face stockouts,Neighborhood grocery stores are turning out to be a godsend for consumers who are confined to their homes during the lockdown.“Kirana stores have functioned as a Sanjeevani for Indian consumers. Currently^ they are the ones who are active and helping meet consumer demands^” said Navin Tewari^ CEO^ Capital Foods. The company offers desi chinese and condiments under Ching’s Secret and Smith & Jones brands.Tewari said the company has witnessed heavy traction in most neighborhood stores^ “especially in the North^ East and West markets. This confidence and trend of dependence on kirana stores is expected to continue even after the lockdown is lifted^” he told BusinessLine.Though the prevailing uncertainties and the lockdown had subdued the demand-supply equation over the last month and a half in the case of pure-play food companies^ Tewari said a V-shaped recovery in demand during Q3 of this calendar year is expected with some pockets already showing an uptick in demand.Typically^ though ‘aata^ daal^ chawal’ are looked upon as basic food items^ noodles^ pasta^ snacks and schezwan chutney have become equally mainstream^ said Tewari^ adding the company has already seen a 50 per cent increase in demand for such products in certain cities.“In the Eastern part of India^ we see good demand from West Bengal^ Jharkhand and Bihar^ and in north India^ from Delhi^ Haryana^ Uttrakhand^ and UP^ we are seeing demand revival. Bengaluru is another market where we are seeing substantial growth in demand^” he added.An intriguing factor is the format of stores. “In the Eastern part^ it is small stores that are fulfilling demand^ while in cities like Bengaluru the large format stores are highly active. We are observing a very strong connection of neighborhood stores that are catering to consumers across the country^ particularly in North and West India^” he added.Tech to aid kirana storesThe country boasts of some 12 million small and medium neighborhood stores^ of which only 25 lakh stores are estimated to be functioning currently.“These are difficult times^” said Kumar Vembu^ CEO and founder of Gofrugal^ which offers cloud and mobile ERP solutions^ and works with over 5^000 kirana stores across the country. “During the lockdown when there is an urgent need for essentials goods^ neighbourhood kirana stores have stepped up their efforts. To empower the efforts of these retailers^ we are waiving the cost of their online ordering and delivery management applications till September 30^” he said.Vembu said the company aims to upgrade all the kirana stores onto a smart platform. The company will help kirana stores set up an exclusive branded android app/iOS app through which consumers can order. The orders will be automatically pushed into the POS making it easier for retailers to measure and improve their capability^ while another app will help manage deliveries efficiently.Nielsen reportA report by Nielsen has also noticed the surge in retail sales among traditional channels. Over the last few weeks^ Nielsen has tracked the development of the Covid-19 situation in India and across the world and has identified six key consumer threshold levels that tie in directly to concerns around the outbreak. The thresholds offer early signals of spending patterns^ with the agency stating these patterns are being mirrored across multiple markets.Despite the fact that FMCG retail sales in India during the pre-lockdown weeks was not as high as that witnessed in western markets^ brick and mortar (kirana) stores and some e-commerce channels have had a gala run registering unprecedented growth^ said the report.In the first week of the lockdown^ however^ the growth run turned into a sharp fall^ with both modern trade (e-commerce) and traditional trade (kirana) channels showing similar lows. E-commerce and Cash and Carry (organised wholesale) channels also saw growth turning from high positive to negative territory between the last two weeks of March^ added the report.Trying to understand the reasons for the sharp fall in the first week of the lockdown^ the agency canvassed 1^240 grocers and chemists from across the country between April 6-12. Stock replenishment and lack of retail manpower were termed key challenges amidst lockdown for FMCG retailers.The report noted retailers faced severe constraints of stock replenishment as company salesperson visits were severely hit^ recording just two salesperson visits a week from an average of 10 visits in a week^ on an average^ during the lockdown period.The agency added most of the retailers (65 per cent of those grocers surveyed and 35 per cent chemists) were also procuring goods at higher rates from wholesalers in the absence of regular visits by salespeople. This resulted in 8 out of 10 retailers not receiving adequate stock of products^ resulting in some bit of stock outs.Edelweiss Securities^ in a report^ also pointed out that though pantry loading of essentials will continue for at least one-two quarters^ companies with large summer portfolios like cooling oils^ talcum powder^ ice creams^ etc are bound to see a slide in the coming weeks. While idle stock will continue to remain at depots and warehouses^ paucity of truckers is expected to lead to stock outs at kirana stores.,20,04
2020-04-19,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/stock-fundamental-analysis-india/how-has-covid-19-impacted-mahindra-logistics/article31381046.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,How has Covid-19 impacted Mahindra Logistics‘,The ongoing lockdown has impacted many sectors. For the logistics industry^ the lack of clarity on policies on transportation of essential and non-essential goods^ lakhs of stranded vehicles on roads and the absence of migrant labourers^ a key resource for warehousing and transportation segments^ are big dampeners Talking to BusinessLine about the current challenges and the outlook for the logistics industry^ Rampraveen Swaminathan^ MD and CEO at Mahindra Logistics^ said it will take several weeks for the industry to stabilise after the lockdown is lifted. Excerpts:What are the current challenges the industry is facing?There are about two to three specific challenges. Though transportation of both essential and non-essential goods are allowed^ there is lack of clarity around what forms essential services.It is unclear whether extended services that enable essential services is also considered essential.Though the ministries are clarifying^ State-level orders are opaque. Even the e-commerce market players^ who have been allowed to operate from Day 1^ are facing significant disruptions.The other problem that really stands out is that vehicles are stuck on highways. During the initial part of the lockdown^ many drivers went home^ leaving the vehicles behind on the road. Today^ probably 30-35 per cent of the vehicles do not have drivers.The third challenge is movement of migrant labourers. This is despite the company taking enough safety precautions and assuring them of full salary during the lockdown period.A lot of our warehouses need contract resources. So^ absenteeism is another main problem.These issues will have a larger impact once we start ramping up.What is the current scale of operations in your transportation and warehousing segments?There has been a big impact on the scale of operations^ not just on our company but on the industry as whole.On the supply-chain side^ the scale of operations has come down significantly. The mobility segment is down as well.On the warehousing side^ 30-35 sites have been working on essential services and that too^ not on full capacity. They now operate at around 40-50 per cent capacity utilisation against the usual run rate of about 90 per cent.On a whole^ about 20-25 per cent of the business is into serving essential services. So^ that part of the business is still operating.How many of your vehicles are stranded on highways? What is the risk of theft of goods from the vehicles ?A considerable number of our vehicles are stranded but in our case^ the risk of theft is almost nil because we have stockyards and vehicle yards across India.We moved most of our stranded vehicles into these locations or to the dhabas with whom we have relations.So^ for now^ our vehicles and customer assets are all secure.Your business operates on an asset-light model? Has that helped?Most of our costs are direct costs^ variable to our business volumes. Costs that are longer-term and fixed in nature are basically three. One^general overheads^ two^ some part of our manpower cost^ and lastly^ warehouse lease payments.On all these fronts^ we have taken action to mitigate the impact.Also^ we are a zero-debt company. We have cash in the balance sheet and lines of credit available. At this stage^ I believe^ we do not have any problem in operating the company for about 70 days. Beyond that^ we will have to see the nature of the lockdown and whether we have to infuse more capital. But at this stage^ for 90-180 days^ we are covered and secured.And we will take steps to maintain liquidity in the business.How does the steep fall in crude prices help road logistics players?The drop in fuel costs will help a little bit^ but^ I think^ it all depends on the type of contract the transporters have entered into.In the case of short-term or one-time placement contracts^ customers do not worry too much about fuel prices. But in large contracts^ yes^ the transporter benefits on account of drop in fuel prices. But typically^ large contracts^ which are for multiple years^ and the segment which we work in for a large part^ mostly carry a fuel clause. They protect us from escalation of fuel costs^ but we also need to pass on the benefits to our customers if there is a reduction in fuel costs.What challenges do you foresee once the lockdown is lifted?The availability of resources will be challenging in the short run.One^ will be bringing back the drivers. Two^ the availability of trucks (vehicles are at different destinations and stranded).They have cargo which has to be dispatched. They have to reach their end-point before they take new cargo.On account of all of this^ there could be cost escalation. The customers have to endure some rise in costs as well in the short term.It will take several weeks for operations to stabilise both in transportation and warehousing^ depending on size^ location^ customers.Further^ we have to see what happens to demand after that.What would be the new normal is the larger question.What is your outlook for FY21 and FY22?Every sector will have its own cycle of recovery.We are a broad-based company. Half of our business is from automotive^ while the other is from non-automotive. In the latter^ we will try to focus on sectors such as e-commerce^ consumer businesses and enterprise mobility that can recover soon.So^ we are confident that we will have a strong second half of FY21^ and FY22 will be above normal.Mahindra Logistics expects to add 30-40 clients every year? Will that number be revised now?In difficult market conditions^ when some sectors are not doing well^ we try to increase our account additions in other sectors.We are focussed on adding accounts in the consumer segment — FMCG/durables/retail. We also aim to increase accounts in e-commerce business^ enterprise mobility and engineering and manufacturing spaces.We have added 25-30 clients in FY20. And going ahead^ we expect the same run rate to continue^ or slightly more^ in FY21. (The company has around 300 clients as on March 2020.)How does the force majeure clause impact the company?Either we can invoke force majeure on our inward supplies where we can cut our costs or expenses^ or our customers can use force majeure on us. Thus far^ we have been working with our customers and we have observed no major concern.Our customers are also under pressure to obtain some rebates^ and seek cost optimisation.We cannot invoke force majeure randomly as we want the capacities to be retained.We all understand that we have to get back to normal and ramp back quickly.What measures are you expecting from the government?The government must lay down clarity in the transportation of both essential and non-essential goods. Inter-State movement of goods has to be opened up in some regulated form.Also^ I think^ the government has to come up with a larger stimulus package^ given the size of our nation and the size of the informal sector^ for the consumption to pick-up.Also^ maintaining liquidity while balancing the fiscal deficit is important.Do you think there will be consolidation in the industry?Possibly. With a huge impact on the scale of operations now^ the smaller transporters may fade away.Many private equity-funded transport entities^ who were on the mode of acquiring clients by discounting the prices^ will find these times challenging.I think^ there would be some consolidation which is good for the industry. It will bring in some price discipline.,19,04

It is one of our quickest launches^ brought to the forefront in record-time^ to address the surging consumer demand given the current pandemic. As a responsible corporate^ we are committed to serve our consumers to the best of our abilities with products which are essential to them.”As the demand for hand hygiene essentials reaches its peak^ Marico has forayed into this category under its long-standing brand^ Mediker^ a 50-year old brand with a niche equity in the protection space^ it said.This newly launched range will be gradually made available across medical stores^ kiranas^ modern retail outlets and e-commerce platforms in select cities. This launch augments the company’s hygiene portfolio which currently offers anti-lice treatment shampoo and oil under the Mediker brand^ it said.These hand sanitizer packs have 70 per cent v/v alcohol content that is sufficient to kill 99.9 per cent germs without water^ ensuring effective protection on-the-go from disease-causing germs.To start with^ Marico plans to donate a part of the production of the sanitizers to some of the Suraksha Stores - a unique private public initiative where FMCG companies including Marico are collectively supporting the Government in helping neighborhood grocery stores embrace safe and hygienic practices. In addition^ some will also be allocated to the community and its partner ecosystem^ it said.,16,04

2020-04-14,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/lockdown-extension-is-no-surprise-but-lack-of-economic-roadmap-is/article31341331.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Lockdown extension is no surprise^ but lack of economic roadmap is,In his Tuesday speech^ the Prime Minister strove to drive home the point that the 21-day lockdown had slowed the march of coronavirus (which indeed^ it has)^ while arguing for another 19-day extension. The plan to gradually relax restrictions on economic activity^ from April 20^ in areas that show a sustained reduction in Covid cases can help relieve the economic distress caused by the breakdown of the supply and output chains. If rabi harvesting and procurement proceed smoothly^ it could inject incomes into rural India. However^ what remains a puzzle to this day is the Centre’s delay in coming up with a cogent economic plan that goes beyond the minimalist ₹1.7-lakh crore distress relief package announced last month. If the implementation of the lockdown as well as amelioration measures are to be left to the States^ the Centre needs to transfer funds at the earliest. So far^ a paltry ₹17^289 crore has been transferred to the States as part of its 2020-21 allocation of ₹28^983 crore for the State Disaster Response Fund^ spelt out by the 15th Finance Commission. With tax revenues expected to fall drastically short this fiscal^ it’s a back-to-the-drawing-board situation — both for fiscal and monetary policy. Yet^ key policy actors have not grasped the nettle^ as other crisis-hit economies have done.Demand^ investment and savings^ including income from remittances^ are poised for a free fall. The issue at hand is to revive production in sectors where inventories are low and employment potential is high. Industries which fit the bill are textiles^ garments^ leather^ food processing^ FMCG; besides^ pharma and medical accessories^ which are perhaps the sole drivers of the economy today^ are expected to ramp up activities. It would be a mistake^ as the government seems to suggest from time to time^ to restrict the opening up of activities to ‘essentials’. If inventories in housing are high^ public infrastructure programmes should be taken up. A roadmap along these lines would lift confidence in India’s economic prospects. To restore liquidity and velocity of money circulation^ the RBI should further liberalise its lending norms^ taking a leaf or two from the UK and the US^ and provide cash-strapped industry with the funds to resume operations. It should further widen the ‘ways and means advances’ window^ from which States can borrow at the repo rate^ to beyond ₹42^000 crore for this year. The Centre^ while exhorting industry to keep employees on its rolls^ needs to loosen its purse strings as well.It is hoped that a package for both small and large industries^ as anticipated^ will be unveiled soon. Farm distress should be averted in horticulture crops by implementing price stabilisation measures; that will lift demand as well. India needs to keep its economy going^ even if it has to implement lockdowns in phases and pockets.,14,04
2020-04-14,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/logistics/covid-19-fallout-truck-movements-yet-to-normalise/article31336325.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Covid-19 fallout: Truck movements yet to normalise,Manpower shortage apart^ fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are battling supply chain glitches following the Covid-19-induced lockdown in India. But 20 days into the lockdown^ movement of trucks continues to be an issue.Market sources^ including FMCG majors^ point out that vehicular movement “still” remains affected^ severely impacting supplies^ both at the manufacturing and retail ends. Goods vehicles / carriers remain stuck along state borders or on highways.“There is not enough coordination between state-level authorities regarding essential transport^” Kartik Johari^ Vice President^ Nobel Hygiene^ said. Nobel Hygiene makes the ‘Friends’ brand of adult diapers.Reduced truck movementAccording to major transport operators in West Bengal^ between two lakh and three lakh trucks ply on the highways in the state on any given day. This includes vehicles entering or exiting and those on the roads.However^ since the lockdown^ not more than 20^000-25^000 trucks are plying daily. Nearly 50^000 vehicles (including those with national permit) remain stuck across different border areas and depots^ or are stranded on the highways.Nationally^ around one lakh trucks are said to be stuck across state borders^ say sources.“Yes^ problems in truck movements persist^ and it will still take another two to five days for normalcy to return. We are coordinating with the police and calling up different transport associations to simplify the process of obtaining passes or releasing vehicles that are stuck at state borders or midway (under a particular administrative district)^” Prabir Chatterjee^ Secretary^ Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Association^ told BusinessLine.Operators says over the first two weeks^ not more that 10^000 trucks were on the roads. Most had been left midway by drivers and helpers.Far from normalThe situation is far from normal. A company can get an e-pass and ensure movement of goods. But^ what happens to the previous consignments that do not have these passes^ representatives of different FMCG majors who are trying to clear these stuck vehicles^ ask. Releasing them or getting permission for their movement is a Herculean task^ they say.According to Shahrukh Khan^ Director – Operations^ Dabur India^ difficulties exist in the smooth functioning of the supply chain^ despite steps taken by the central and state governments to ease truck movements.“The situation is far from normal. Companies are facing difficulties^ both in servicing domestic demand and (also in) meeting export commitments^” he said.Operators say truck movement was first hit when states announced their own containment measures. Vehicles carrying non-essential items got stuck. Some movement was still being managed at the grassroots. But the national lockdown brought things to a halt.It was always clear that vehicles carrying “essentials” will be allowed movement. But the definition of essentials varied at local administration levels. This led to hindrance in movement.More clarity in rulesMeanwhile^ Ajay Bhalla^ Union Home Secretary^ in an April 12 letter to the Chief Secretaries of all States^ raised the issues of “trucks carrying essentials and non-essentials being detained”^ workers needed for manufacturing operations not getting passes^ and inter-state movement of goods getting hampered^ among others.Accordingly^ the ministry clarified and reiterated some previous guidelines. These include that inter- and intra-state movement of “all trucks and other goods / carrier vehicles” be allowed with “one driver and one additional person^ irrespective of the nature of the cargo”^ and no further permits are required.

This is among the key measures the ayurvedic and natural health care company has taken^ in a bid to meet the growing need for immunity-boosting products.Mohit Malhotra^ Chief Executive Officer^ Dabur India^ told BusinessLine: “Dabur has a strong pipeline of new products in place with many of these being in the healthcare and personal hygiene space. Prior to the Covid-19 spread^ we had prepared a launch strategy for these products. Given the spread of the disease^ we have decided to pull forward launch plans to meet the needs of our consumers across the country.”This is in line with the company’s strategy of focussing on the consumer health division with stepped up investments on the brand and continued innovation^ he added.Just as the Covid-19 outbreak intensified in India^ Dabur advanced the launch of its hand-sanitiser brand Dabur Sanitize. Similarly^ earlier this month^ it launched immunity-boosting tonic Dabur Tulsi Drops^ which was earlier set for a June launch.In line with this nimble-footed launch strategy^ the company has now decided to launch a range of single herb churnas which include immunity-boosters like Giloy Churna^ Amla Churna and Ashwagandha Churna. The other products in this range are Hareetaki (Harad) Chura^ Neem Churna^ Arjun Chhal Churna and Brahmi Churna.Malhotra believes that in the post Covid-19 world^ the importance of personal hygiene and ayurveda-backed preventive healthcare will grow in the consumer mindspace in India and international markets. “I feel healthcare would gain as consumers would be seeking more preventive healthcare products for boosting their immunity. Even personal hygiene products like hand-sanitisers would become an essential part of the monthly grocery basket^” he said.Ramping up productionMeanwhile^ the company has also ramped up production of its existing range to ensure uninterrupted supplies of its healthcare and medicine products.“Our speed of innovation^ ability to marry ayurvedic knowledge with modern-day science and complete focus on quality are our key strengths. Even as we face disruptions during the lockdown^ our employees and partners have risen to the occasion to source raw materials and packing materials and ensure speedy resumption of production of essential products^” he added.Besides^ the company has also strengthened tie-ups with online platforms for timely delivery of its products to consumers. “We are also working with the government to help widen the reach of Ayurvedic products^ which are highly beneficial in today’s context^” Malhotra added.,13,04

The first week saw capacity utilisation stand at 15 per cent^ on average^ with many FMCG majors still working to get permissions going and restart operations.According to Abneesh Ray^ Executive Vice-President – Institutional Equities^ Edelweiss Securities^ a lot depends on the partial relaxation of lockdown rules that the Centre and State governments will frame and implement. It should help boost up manufacturing activities and also availability^ especially that of essentials.“From the third week^ there is expected to be further improvement in capacity utilisation. It could be between 35 and 50 per cent across the industry. In fact^ it can go actually up to 70-80 per cent depending on how the lockdown rules are framed and enforced at a local administration level^” he told BusinessLine.Diversified conglomerate ITC Ltd said it has received approvals from a number of State authorities to manufacture essential commodities.“These factories have been operating with restricted number of hours and reduced workforce in line with approval from local authorities^” a company spokesperson said^ adding that “efforts are being made to ensure that the supply chain functions smoothly despite the challenges of manpower shortages and availability of trucks”.Improvement on groundAccording to Sunil Kataria^ CEO – India & SAARC^ Godrej Consumer Products Ltd^ there has been “some improvement on ground in the last few days”. The government is working hand-in-hand with the industry to “help clear obstacles in running the supply chains”.“Our factories are manufacturing only essential products^ operating at 30-35 per cent capacity due to some manpower and logistical challenges. Efforts are on to ramp up production in line with the government guidelines^” he said.Nobel Hygiene^ makers-of adult diapers brand^ Friends^ said the company has been operating at 25 per cent capacity for quite some time. According to Kartik Johari^ Vice-President^ Nobel Hygiene^ there are plans to ramp up production too. “Ramp up^ absolutely. (We intend) to take it up to at least 50 per cent of workforce. As an essential we need to be prepared for the incoming demand^” he said.Other companies like Jyothy Labs^ which had^ till last week^ not received permission for resumption of operations^ told BusinessLine that operations have resumed across some factories and in select product lines that manufacture essentials.“Three of our factories have reopened this week^” MR Jyothy^ Managing Director^ Jyothy Labs^ said.,13,04

Each FMCG company might be given one or two states to execute this plan effectively and enable every store to fight coronavirus.When contacted^ Agarwal said the government is “working” on the ‘Suraksha Store’ plan but declined to share any detail.To become a ‘Suraksha Store’^ a retail store will have to comply with a health and safety checklist^ which includes social distancing of 1.5 metres outside the shop as well as billing counters^ use of sanitiser or handwash by consumers before entering shops^ provision of masks to all staff and sanitisation of high touch areas twice a day.The ‘Suraksha Store’ will not only be for groceries but also consumer durables^ apparel and salons.A top official at a leading FMCG firm confirmed the development.“The government is planning to create Suraksha Store and Suraksha Circle to ensure hygiene and safety norms across the supply chain. More than 50 top FMCG companies have been approached. We are with the government^ and we have already given our approval to participate in this exercise actively^” said the official^ who wished not to be identified.FMCG companies will be asked to provide training and mobilise health kits (masks^ gloves and sanitisers) to enable retail outlets to become ‘Suraksha Stores’^ the official said^ adding that big industries would similarly help wholesalers and other smaller units.As per the plan^ each retail outlet will have to prominently display that it is a ‘Suraksha Store’ to customers. Educational posters related to hygiene and safety should also be displayed in the store.Similarly^ the Consumer Affairs Ministry is working on creating ‘Suraksha Circle’ where lead manufacturing plants will help their business partners and smaller factories in their vicinity to ensure a safe environment across the product supply chain.Each lead manufacturing plant is expected to adopt 10 SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and one village in order to achieve the target to bring 50^000 SMEs and 5^000 communities under Suraksha Circle.According to the plan^ an online training certification programme will be created for Suraksha Stores and Suraksha Circle to ensure awareness about Covid-19 protocols for the supply of essential commodities as per the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).,12,04

The possibility of a massive shift in consumer behaviour^ driven largely by an increased adoption of technology and a rise in home consumption of products rather than that on the go^ are likely to be the key drivers for change in the industry.According to Mayank Jalan^ CMD^ Keventer Agro^ the FMCG industry has been largely driven by ‘single serve on the go consumption’ but that is something which is likely to undergo a change following a shift in consumer’s buying pattern.“After this lockdown^ it is not probably going to be business as usual. It is actually not going to be a restart but more likely a reset for FMCG companies^ particularly those in the food business^” Jalan told BusinessLine.Changing consumer behaviourWhile it is still early to estimate the impact of the current crisis on the industry^ it is however likely that e-commerce and home delivery will take precedence in the buying pattern of consumers^ moving forward. This is also likely to prompt FMCG companies^ which have typically been catering to on the go customers^ to focus more on home consumption.Apart from this^ consumers who have been largely dependent on buying vegetables and meat from the unorganised wet markets are likely to move towards organised players where quality and hygiene parameters are adhered to.Another important shift that is likely to happen in the coming days is the increased acceptance of and demand for food centred on health and wellness. In India^ demand for health and wellness products has so far been latent and limited to high-end urban population.Nimble and lean companiesIn the current situation^ it is important for companies to be “nimble and lean” and take into account changes that are likely to emerge on an ongoing basis.Indian corporates usually work on a medium to long-term plans and are not too adept at responding quickly to changes. However^ the current situation warrants very short-term plans to be able to respond to emerging situations^ Jalan said.“We (at Keventer Agro) generally work on two-to-three-year plans^ but now we are working on one-week^ four-week and 12-week plans ... taking one week at a time^” he said.Keventer Agro^ which is into pouch and UHT milk^ beverages^ frozen food and banana^ had recorded a growth of around 26 per cent between January and March 15 this year. However^ for the full year^ it is likely to report a degrowth across both staple and non-staple categories.New initiativesThe company has accelerated the rollout of several technological initiatives^ including online delivery of products through Zomato^ direct delivery to residential complexes and setting up store locators to know the availability of products across various outlets in a given area^ in the last ten days.

It is actually not going to be like a restart^ but more like a reset^ in every aspect. While the industry may be surviving post this kind of a lockdown or a pandemic^ but whether we will be actually prospering^ or will we be having the kind of disposable income to go out and spend is something that needs to be seen. These are questions which are unanswered as of now. It is a complete reset button which FMCG companies^ particularly those in the food business will have to look into^” Jalan told BusinessLine.Changing consumer behaviourWhile it is still early to estimate the impact of the current crisis on the industry^ it is likely that e-commerce and home delivery would take precedence in the buying pattern of consumers moving forward.

More than 90 per cent of fresh vegetables or meat in India is currently sold through wet markets where hygiene is a big issue. So^ a shift to organised players from unorganised market is likely to be fuelled moving forward^” Jalan said.Whether this shift in consumer buying pattern would lead to increased consumption of frozen food and vegetables is something that would be seen in the next 6-12 months.Another important shift that is likely to happen is the increased acceptance and demand for food centred around health and wellness. While in India there was demand for health and wellness products^ it was more latent and limited to high-end urban population.“Health and wellness is at the forefront of everybody’s mind today…..so it is likely to lead to a situation where consumers will demand products which are hygienic and healthy. This in turn might lead FMCG companies evolving a portfolio of products built around health^ immunity and protection^” he said.Rural consumption – a concernWhile consumption in urban areas may pick up slowly in the coming months^ the rural or semi-urban markets^ which accounts for nearly 60-70 per cent of the country’s economy^ remains to be a concern.The urban population may be quick to respond to changes in food pattern focusing more on health and wellness and may also adopt technology for the delivery of products^ however^ the same may not happen in case of rural markets.The harvesting of kharif crop and some of the plantation crops^ like mango and tea^ is likely to be impacted due to the ongoing crisis^ and this in turn is likely to create an agrarian distress.“If you start getting into the cycle where farmers and rural hinterland are not getting income^ then the rural demand^ which has been driving the FMCG industry over the last decade^ may be impacted. Once the rural demand starts falling behind the curve^ it takes incredibly long time for it to come back^” he observed.‘Nimble and lean’ companiesGiven the current circumstances^ it is important for companies to be “nimble and lean” and take into account the changes that are likely to emerge on an ongoing basis.Indian corporates usually work on a medium to long term plan and are not too adept to respond quickly to changes.

These are things which we have to do on an ongoing basis rather than wait for the lockdown to get over^” he said.Consumption downKeventer Agro^ which is into pouch and UHT milk^ beverages^ frozen food and banana^ which had recorded a growth of around 26 per cent between January to March 15^ 2020^ is set to report a degrowth following the lockdown. This is despite the fact that milk sales (both pouch and UHT) have been good.“Though milk consumption in houses has increased^ but 30-40 per cent of the consumption happens in hotels^ restaurants^ offices^ institutions etc which are now shut. This has impacted sales^” he said.However^ the company has accelerated roll out of several technological initiatives including online delivery of products through Zomato^ direct delivery to residential complexes and setting up store locators to know the availability of products across various outlets in a given area^ in the last ten days. The company is also in the process of rolling out an e-commerce based subscription model in the next 15-30 days.“As of now consumption is not up to mark^ logistics issues have sorted out to a great extent but still I am not planning for any growth in the next two to three months. So for Q1 2021 we are not giving any direction but we will work on a weekly basis^” he said.The company is planning to put in lot of investments on its UHT milk business moving forward.

As stocks are getting depleted^ kirana store owners are saddled with only cereals and pulses^ with empty racks staring at them.Ramesh^ a kirana store owner at Domalguda in the city^ said only non-MRP (maximum retail price) supplies are coming in.Logistical hurdles“It’s just rice^ daal and sugar ... nothing else is coming to us. When I called our regular set of distributors for replenishment of stocks^ they said there are no trucks and drivers^” he told BusinessLine.While announcing the lockdown^ both the State and the Central governments exempted the movement of essential commodities from the purview of the restrictions. Despite initial hiccups where trucks carrying staple food items^ processed and unprocessed^ faced roadblocks^ the State government stepped in and asked the police not to stop the vehicles that carry essential commodities.“I sold almost all of the supplies that I secured before the lockdown. Now^ I don’t have any processed food (biscuits^ snacks^ spices and oil)^” Ramesh said.The organised retail stores are better off. Backed with their own or third party logistic services^ they are able to get steady supplies. It’s not the same with the mom-and-pop shop owners^ who by and large^ depend on supplies from wholesale distributors.“The government did exempt the essential commodities from lockdown restrictions. But the issue is availability of trucks and drivers. In the absence of vehicles and drivers^ the distributors are not able to move the products^” a leader of the Hyderabad Kirana Merchants Association^ said on condition of anonymity.Price hikeAs the movement of stock is restricted for want of fleet^ prices of cereals and pulses have gone up by 5-15 per cent in different parts of the city.“It’s a matter of demand and supply. There’s a slight increase in prices of (rice^ daal) owing to the constraints in the movement of stocks^” he said.He^ however^ felt that it would be back to normal once the supply chain engine gets back to normalcy.“The markets have been closed. The wholesalers will procure the stocks from there and distribute them to the lower end of the supply chain. Their hands are tied as their staff could not report to duties because of the lockdown^” Venkata Reddy^ a kirana store owner in Himayatnagar^ said.,07,04

Some CFAs too have received permissions to distribute goods^” said Sunil Kataria^ CEO (India and SAARC)^ Godrej Consumer Products Ltd^ told BusinessLine. If one goes by volumes^ nearly 85 per cent of its manufacturing is done in-house; while another 15 per cent is outsourced.Emami Agrotech restarted operations at its edible oil plants in Jaipur (Rajasthan)^ Haldia (West Bengal) and Krishnapatnam (Andhra Pradesh). All plants were made operational in a phased manner over the last 4-5 days.Select products^ limited staffITC Ltd said ensuring adequate availability of essential food and hygiene products in the country was critical. Accordingly^ it was “working closely” with State authorities and local administration to ensure that manufacturing and distribution activities continue uninterrupted with minimum people.“While we have progressively obtained permission in some States^ availability of trucks continues to be the biggest challenge at the moment. Inter-State and local truck movement has been severely impacted along with the challenge of shortage of manpower in factories^” a company spokesperson said.Incidentally^ market sources point to more items being added to the list of “essential items”^ and as ambiguities clear^ capacity utilisation is expected to ramp up.Godrej says its priority has been to ramp up production of soaps^ hand wash and sanitizers^ as these products have been included in the essential items list. It also remains “committed to dramatically reduce the number of people involved in its manufacturing^ warehousing and distribution” by 50 per cent^ while also ensuring global standards of safety and hygiene.Similarly^ Dabur India Ltd’s Executive Director-Operations Shahrukh Khan said that approvals are in place and will be restarting production of its hygiene products soon.“We have already got the approvals in place and will be restarting production of our hygiene products^ including sanitisers and hand wash^ over the coming days.

On the other^ the present lockdown^ looming threat of a recession and uncertainty over future operations are forcing companies to cut down their ad spending to focus only on bare essentials.“Should we ride this opportunity wave and continue to advertise^ or should we pull back and wait for the normal times is a true dilemma that advertisers are having now^” Elango M^ Vice-President^ FCBInterface Communications^ an end-to-end branding and advertising solutions company.Some of the leading clients of FCBInterface^ which is a part of the FCB network in India^ include Blue Star^ Nivea^ Oreo^ the Mahindra Group^ Cipla and Quikr.Elango^ who estimates the industry to lose around 30-40 per cent business this season^ said that many FMCG advertisers are not pulling back on campaigns^ hoping that the salience that brands enjoy now will be helpful when things get back to normal.TV viewership in India has been on the peak ever since the 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24.Increase in TV timeAccording to a recent report released by television monitoring agency BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) and marketing research firm Nielsen^ TV consumption hit an all-time high of 1.2 trillion minutes during March 21-27. The consumption is 37 per cent higher than the comparable pre-Covid-19 period (January 11-31).As a result^ average daily FCT (free commercial time) also grew by six lakh seconds (15 per cent) during March 21-27. The food and beverages category recorded the highest increase in FCT share followed by personal care and hygiene products.FCT refers to the amount of seconds bought on a channel for advertising.“The current spike in TV viewership is due to lockdown^ and people are not watching TV out of interest. So this cannot be a big booster for the advertisement industry^” said M Lawrance^ Director of Chennai-based Ice Media^ which provides branding^ ad film making (production)^ corporate videos and ad film release services for television media.“Our business has gone down by 70-80 per cent this month as compared to last year. We already saw some decline in March; but for April^ it is fully washed out^” Lawrance said.Some of the advertising clients of Ice Media include CavinKare^ Milky Mist^ Bharat Matrimony and Sakthi Masala.“Our food category ads are going on^ but in that too^ we have reduced the number of channels and are focussing only on news channels^” Lawrance added.Time to engageBut industry experts say this is the right time for brands to come forward and advertise and engage with the consumers.“This is the time when consumers have all the time in the world. If you don’t advertise now^ when things come back to normal^ you tend to lose a lot in the medium term^” said N Chandramouli^ a brand expert and CEO of TRA Research.“Because some contrarian companies are advertising now^ so customers naturally tend to gravitate towards those brands^” he added.Chandramouli also said the advantage which brands enjoyed before Covid-19^ may not be available to them after the crisis is over^ because people have become cautious with their preference and approach.“Whenever something unexpected challenges the society^ it is also an opportunity for brands to show empathy and engage with consumers through socially relevant messaging^” said FCBInterface’s Elango.Typically^ the festival months (October-December) are considered to be peak season for advertising. A quick recovery may help the industry to recoup its losses.“Even if the worst is over by May-June^ we should be back for the festival season^” Lawrance of Ice Media said.,06,04

The correction provides buying opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon. Investors with a moderately high risk appetite looking to invest in the large- and mid-cap category can accumulate units of Kotak Equity Opportunities. Investing through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route can mitigate market volatility.The fund has steadily outperformed its benchmark index^ the Nifty 200 TRI over the past one-^ three-and five-year periods. In the longer term^ for instance^ over the past seven- and 10-year periods^ the fund has outpaced the benchmark by 2-3 per cent. The fund has been rated five-star by BusinessLine Portfolio Star Track MF Ratings.In the last one year^ the fall in the scheme’s NAV has been lower than its benchmark’s — the fund has tumbled 23.3 per cent^ whereas the Nifty 200 TRI has plummeted 28.9 per cent.Performance and strategyAfter marginally outperforming the category in 2017^ the fund turned an underperformer in 2018.But it bounced back strongly in 2019 and registered category-beating returns.

2020-04-03,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/logistics/demand-for-consumer-goods-keeps-logistics-platforms-going/article31245912.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Demand for consumer goods keeps logistics platforms going,Covid-19 has not only brought the whole world to a standstill but also disrupted businesses across sectors. Things are no different for the $200 billion-plus Indian logistics industry — most supplies and deliveries came to a grinding halt when the country went into a nationwide lockdown.But these platforms are now beginning to see a silver lining^ thanks to the persistent demand for consumer goods.Praharsh Chandra^ co-founder and COO of Shadowfax^ a crowd-sourced business to business (B2B) last-mile delivery services platform^ said it has seen more than a 2X increase in demand from its grocery and pharma clients over the past few days.“We have been focussing our energies on enabling deliveries of these essential commodities during the lockdown^” Chandra said. “Other non-essential categories have seen drops of almost 90 per cent^” he added.Sachin Haritash^ founder & CEO of Mavyn^ a digital trucking company^ said the company has been seeing a nearly 150 per cent surge in business since Monday^ due to the increase in demand for FMCG products.According to a recent report by logistics platform ClickPost and Shadowfax^ the Indian e-commerce logistics industry saw a 21 per cent increase in order delays and a 9 per cent rise in stuck shipments between March 10 and March 20. This was even before the government announced the nationwide lockdown^ on March 24. Data also showed that deliveries had already declined by 9 per cent during that period.“The consumer durable and auto industry are in complete lockdown with almost no business^” said Haritash. He added that the e-commerce industry business is down 90 per cent and only grocery shipments are happening.In the aftermath of Covid-19^ the company is only recording a cumulative 20 per cent business^ Haritash said. He also estimated the impact on the logistics industry would be $40-50 billion by April 15.Due to the lockdown^ e-commerce has also been facing disruptions^ with a few warehouse locations becoming unserviceable. Furthermore^ the number of deliveries that were sent back to the pick-up location — the return to origin rate — has also climbed over the past few days.“There has been an initial increase in return to origin percentages last week^ of 9-10 percentage points^ since a lot of deliveries got delayed post the lockdown^” said Shadowfax’s Chandra. “However^ we expect it to reduce significantly from this week onwards^” he added.Challenges in deliveryThanks to the rising demand for consumer goods and the fact that the public is not too keen to step out to make purchases at stores and supermarkets^ these firms now cater to more districts and cities across the country. But how are they managing the surge — be it in terms of the documents required to travel or the shortage of riders to deliver goods? What are the impediments these firms are facing? How are these platforms ensuring the timely delivery of goods?“One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that our delivery partners have appropriate government-sanctioned passes and are not stopped by police administration in any of the cities^” said Chandra.The delivery rates have also shot up 300-400 per cent for short distances (100-800 km) and 150-200 per cent (more than 800 km) for long distances^ said Mavyn’s Haritash.To keep the business going^ these platforms are finding new ways to manage deliveries in the most effective ways possible. They are also ramping up their fleet to serve as many orders as possible to make up for the dearth of riders.Pratish Sanghvi^ co-founder of Grab^ a last-mile logistics company for businesses^ said that due to the significant drop in the food-tech space^ a lot of riders who were earlier with companies such as Zomato and Swiggy recently joined Grab.He added that they are trying to integrate deliveries in such a way that more customers can be served^ plus the rider also spends a shorter period of time on the field.,03,04
2020-04-03,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/retail-sales-recovery-could-resume-this-may/article31244154.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Retail sales recovery could resume this May,"As the Covid-19 pandemic forces retail stores to down their shutters^ signalling an unprecedented disruption of commerce^ a new study has suggested India's retail sales recovery might kick into gear from the first week of May^ if the current lockdown is not extended further.Taking cognisance of what transpired in China when the epidemic unfolded^ and its impact on retailers^ the study by SaaS company Capillary Technologies notes the most resilient retailers to survive the epidemic in China were omnichannel retailers. It predicts that Indian brands that invest in enabling a personalised omnichannel shopping experience would be able to experience the fruits of their labour once the lockdown situation eases.Capillary Technologies conducted the survey to analyse the impact of Covid-19 in the retail industry across India^ China^ Singapore and the Middle East. Around 10^000 stores in these geographies were surveyed before and during the lockdown.Speaking to BusinessLine about the India-specific findings^ Aneesh Reddy^ CEO of Capillary Technologies said: “We have noticed a larger drop in sales for Single Brand Outlets compared to Multi Brand Outlets (MBOs) in India since the outbreak. This is possibly due to customers preferring to minimise travel by shopping at a single shop for multiple products or brands.”Recording the recovery period in China^ the study showed that after just eight weeks into the initial lockdown^ the retail market in China was back in the early stages of recovery. The retail sector in China witnessed an uptick in sales and customers after March 6.The ‘probable recovery period’ in China^ as envisaged by the study^ recorded a 22 per cent increase in sales and 43 per cent increase in customers^ which was termed almost at par with last year’s figures.The India pictureIn India^ until March 16^ consumer retail sales and walk-ins did not see much of a dip as compared to last year^ with the study noting it could be due to festive shopping for Ugadi^ Gudi Padwa^ Navratri^ etc.However^ the consumer retail sector in India witnessed a huge slump in sales by 46-55 per cent in the number of customers per store from March 17-25^ according to the study^ adding that this is expected to drop further in the coming weeks due to the ongoing nationwide lockdown.Terming it a very trying period for retailers across the globe^ Reddy said: “Reports suggest that it will take five or six months for the world to recover completely from the impact of this pandemic. In the meantime^ China has set remarkable precedence in not just battling the spread of the virus^ but also supporting the economy.”In India^ the CEO added^ “We are still in the critical phase of a national lockdown. While the Indian government is doing everything to battle the virus^ retailers can also look up to their peers in China and Singapore to save their businesses and chart a quick road to recovery.""The CEO noted that Indian retailers would better understand the power of omnichannel digital transformation after the pandemic. “In the long run^ consumer brands particularly should increase the percentage of their ecommerce business and deploy O2O strategy of reaching consumers across touchpoints to prevent businesses from closing down^” he added^ in a statement.The O2O strategy concerns bringing physical store customers to online stores^ and is considered a necessary ingredient to omnichannel retail^ which is about creating a consistent experience for customers in retail stores and different online channels.In India^ the study notes^ lifestyle and fashion retailers are likely to be impacted most due to the restrictions and lockdowns^ resulting in a demand squeeze. However^ the combination of young demographics^ rising disposable income and the positive headroom growth for organised retail in India could mitigate many of the challenges in the long term.China lessonsRoughly 50 days after the initial lockdown^ China not only witnessed the recovery of economic fundamentals^ but showed signs of upward momentum. China’s economic scale^ strong resilience^ digital penetration and flexible macro policies were among the major factors that led to the rapid recovery^ notes the study^ and adds there are some important lessons to be learned from China on how to successfully deal with the epidemic and chart out a road to recovery in India.From January to February^ China recorded an over 65 per cent drop in average sales per store and a 79 per cent decrease in customers per store. However^ there was an increase in retail sales starting from March 6^ with the study suggesting it has taken around 1.5 months for a recovery to start after the Wuhan lockdown.Being omnichannel also helped retailers in China to be resilient. The study cited Chinese apparel brands like Peacebird^ Gloria and Youngor^ who had undertaken omnichannel digital transformation journeys (through the integration of online and offline channels)^ experiencing a consistent increase in online sales despite the uncertain in-store sales.China has also become the epicentre for livestream commerce^ with Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and JD.com leading the live commerce world by enabling live stream^ wherein viewers can purchase items while they watch. The study adds live commerce has become an emerging trend to bank upon amidst the Covid-19 sales slump^ a lesson that needs to be learnt by Indian retailers.",03,04
2020-04-01,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/as-lockdown-bites-bakers-people-struggle-to-find-bread/article31225431.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,As lockdown bites bakers^ people struggle to find bread,The supply of bread has become scarce as many bakers have shut operations owing to the shortage of labour and disruption in logistics facilities due to the lockdown.As a result^ roller flour millers have seen a drastic decline in sales of refined flour or maida^ a widely used ingredient in the manufacture of bakery products such as bread and biscuits.“There ha been a substantial drop in sales of maida over the past few days. Sales are down by about 90 per cent as the demand from bakeries has come down drastically^” said Sanjeev Puri^ President of the All India Roller Flour Millers Association.Large units cut backWhile the majority of the small bakers has shut operations^ large industrial bakers such as Modern Foods^ Britannia and Kitty Industries^ among others^ are operating at a lower capacity.“Shortage of labour and raw material^ mainly used in packing^ and transportation issues^ have forced us to scale down our production capacity by 60 per cent^” said Ramesh Mago^ promoter of Kitty Industries Pvt Ltd^ in Ludhiana^ which sells bakery products under the Kitty brand across North India.“Also^ the lockdown has impacted demand from both institutions and the retail segment. As a result^ we have stopped manufacturing all other products such as bun^ pav and pizza base^ except bread^” Mago said.Small units worst hitThe Indian bakery sector is largely dominated by smaller units in the unorganised sector. According to market research firm IMARC^ the size of the bakery market^ which was estimated to be $6 billion in 2017^ is expected to grow to $11 billion by 2023.Mago^ who is also president of the All India Bread Manufacturers Association^ said the smaller bakers in the unorganised segment are the worst affected. Though institutional demand has been hit^ there have been instances of increased demand from some retail consumers. “There have been instances of people buying more loaves of bread than normal as supplies have dwindled^” Mago said.With transportation of goods becoming a challenge^ the shortage in supply of bread and related products is being felt in several locations across the country. Though the bakery sector falls under essential food category^ many bakers have not resumed operations despite easing of curbs.“We have shut down our operations for about a week due to the shortage of labour and raw material^” said BS Bhat^ Chairman and Managing Director of Beekays^ a large baker in Bengaluru^ which manufactures about 150 products. The company^ which is highly dependent on migrant labour^ has not seen them returning after they went to their villages to celebrate Ugadi^ Bhat said. Many of the members of the Karnataka Wrapped Bread Manufacturers Association have either stopped operations or are running at a lower capacity^ Bhat said.,01,04

This comes when FMCG majors themselves are struggling to normalise operations that include supply chain management and get transport facilities back on track.Industry sources^ which include FMCG companies^ distributors and retailers^ told BusinessLine that reverse migration of workers have led to a manpower shortage^ thereby impacting distribution and delivery of products.Distributors are now telling retailers^ including small shops and kirana stores^ to arrange their own transport and delivery mechanism as they are either running on skeletal staff or are still awaiting clarity on distribution operations from local administration.Ullas Kamath^ Joint Managing Director^ Jyothy Labs^ said that there is an “evident challenge of transportation of products into the market due to the scarcity of workforce”. “Most of the workers are immigrants from other States. Their presence to smoothen the supply chain is crucial^” he told BusinessLine.Many Bengal-based distributors claimed that there were no labourers to load products nor delivery people. “I have stocks of edible oil^ atta^ maida^ sattu and besan in my go-down. But it is difficult for me to find people who will go deliver them to a kirana store. If they (kirana stores) have their own transport^ they can come down and pick up the stuff^” said a Kolkata-based distributor^ requesting anonymity.ITC Ltd said it may “take a few more days” for the entire eco-system and processes to be streamlined for movement of essential goods.Distrbution Chains HitThe typical modus operandi across neighborhood stores and kiranas involve a representative of a distributor making inquiries with shops either on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Supplies are made accordingly. Emergency shortages are met with calls being made to the distributor directly. Now all of that has stopped.“There are no people who will run such shop-to-shop checks. Nor are their loading people^ neither delivery bodies^” said a distributor. Dabur India points out that the scenario remains “challenging” and in a majority of places^ “there is not much distribution happening”.Grocery shops face shortagesSome kirana stores have closed down for the time being as supply of “fast moving items” have been hit. Even items such as bread^ milk and eggs are available for a short window^ early in the morning.Some of the shopkeepers^ who have downed shutters at the moment^ claim that this will continue for seven to 10 days or until vehicle arrangements are made.“We were not prepared for a 21-day lockdown. But after stocks depleted in the first two to three days^ I decided to down shutters^” a shopkeeper said.Many smaller shopkeepers say they are trying to arrange for transport^ which include pooling-in services (for example three shopkeepers of a locality pitching in to hire one delivery van)^ but vehicles remain unavailable. Local authorities have issued e-passes (for vehicular movement) and many shopkeepers have applied in order to bring in supplies.Companies Help OutFMCG majors said that the absence of manpower is making normalisation of operations difficult. While factories still remain closed in some cases^ there are instances were companies have made operational specific product lines depending on urgency of demand.Adarsh Sharma^ Executive Director – Sales^ Dabur India^ said he was in “constant touch” with those stockist points which are open and were supporting them. “We have also established a direct contact with retailers and are trying to service demand^ wherever possible^” he said.Jyothy Labs said it had a “comfortable” inventory level with 2-3 weeks of stocks. It is quite hopeful of resuming production as the situation improves.,31,03

It also held a video-conferencing interaction with key industry bodies and stakeholders on Monday after urging State government to allow food units to operate.Pushpa Subrahmanyam^ Secretary^ Food Processing Ministry^ told BusinessLine^ “We are attempting to resolve various issues of the industry related to closure of factories^ warehouses^ cold storages as well problems with inter-State movements..which we have received from industry associations and individual units. We have taken up these grievances with the State governments and many of them have been resolved. About 10 per cent of them were related to clarifications on MHA notification.”According to sources^ nearly 221 grievances were registered so far with the Ministry^ while 98 of them have been resolved^ 105 are under resolution.Migration of workersOn Sunday^ the Home Ministry also allowed transportation of both essential and non-essential goods and at the same time expanded the list of essential goods to include hygiene products. However^ large scale reverse migration of workers to their home States is now posing as a bigger challenge for essential good manufacturers and supply chains.Vivek Gambhir^ Managing Director and CEO^ Godrej Consumer Products Ltd^ said the recent Central government guidelines will help ease the existing supply chain bottlenecks.“Consequently^ we are seeing some progress on-ground. Some factories have received permissions to manufacture essential hygiene products^ at reduced capacity. Some CFAs too have received permissions to distribute goods. However^ the number of workers reporting to factory/distributor locations is still very low due to social pressure and safety concerns^” he said.Mayank Shah^ Category Head^ Parle Products^ said the industry is likely to attain uninterrupted operations at factories^ though with scaled down workforces in line with government directives^ by next week and will be able to meet the demand of the consumers to a large extent.Streamlining movementA spokesperson for ITC too said^ while the company has progressively obtained permissions in some States^ availability of trucks continues to be the biggest challenge at the moment. “Inter-State and local truck movement has been severely impacted together with the challenge of shortage of manpower in factories. We believe it will take a few more days for the entire eco-system and processes to be streamlined for movement of essential goods^” the spokesperson added.Stating that Central government directives has helped re-starting factory operations and some part of logistics operations^ Piyush Patnaik^ Managing Director^ Cargill’s oils business in India^ said more support on free movement of trucks and availability of labour is needed.Dabur India Ltd Executive Director-Operations Shahrukh Khan said that situation has eased a bit with approvals for plant operations and bottlenecks of raw materials^ packaging materials and finished products.However^ he added with most workers either leaving for their hometowns or staying at home during the lockdown^ it would be a challenge to ensure smooth functioning.,30,03

A Nielsen India study showed that while hygiene products such as hand sanitisers^ masks and soaps have recorded over 100 per cent growth in sales^ other items such as cough syrup^ salty snacks and cooking oil are also seeing a massive spike. The gain is mostly on online platforms. This is good news for e-commerce players and FMCG companies but bad news for offline retailers.Nielsen did an online survey across 15 large Indian metropolitan cities between March 17 and March 19 covering 898 respondents.Data revealed that^ as of February^ around 90 per cent of the citizens were aware of prescribed behaviour^ such as social distancing^ washing hands. However^ more than 40 per cent of people in the metros accepted they were not abiding by the guidance. The trend saw an uptick in March.Between November^ December and January^ the FMCG saw a decline at 6 per cent^ 5 per cent and 5 per cent^ respectively. However^ in February^ the FMCG segment saw a growth of 8 per cent growth. Similarly^ the food segment^ which had declined from an 8 per cent growth in November and December to 7 per cent in January^ grew 10 per cent growth in February.Nielsen’s data signified high growth for health and hygiene product baskets both in the traditional and e-commerce channels. Nielsen reviewed the growth of certain segments in the traditional trade channel. The survey was conducted to review the timeframe between mid-February and mid-March. The hand sanitiser segment witnessed a 144 per cent growth on a year-on-year basis. Liquid soaps recorded a 42 per cent growth and antiseptic liquids a 36 per cent growth. Similarly^ the pulses and atta segment in the traditional trade witnessed a 72 per cent and 25 per cent growth.Spike in e-commerce salesIn the e-commerce channel^ the hand sanitisers segment saw a whopping 1^425 per cent growth^ whereas facemasks recorded a growth of 406 per cent in sales.

Others believe that such a directive will need to evolve with changing times in different phases of India’s battle with Covid-19.Priority listSome industry associations have sent out a suggested list of products that should be considered essential products to maintain a steady supply chain^ to the Consumer Affairs Ministry^ according to sources.This include edibles including staples^ tea^ coffee and spices^ processed and packaged foods^ fresh produce^ dairy^ bakery products and juices^ besides medicines and health supplements; non-edible products such as cleaning products^ including soaps^ detergents and oral care; personal hygiene products like sanitary pads^ diapers and sanitisers^ disinfectants^ mosquito repellents and healthcare and medical equipment^ among others.Changing definitionsSome in the industry also believe even products that serve as ‘work from home’ enablers should be put in essential commodities^ such as laptops^ routers^ power banks^ mobile phones^ cable^ mouse and repair services.A senior retail industry executive said^ “The definition of essential goods may keep evolving with time. Food and hygiene products will remain the key priority but as the lockdown progresses^ there may be shortages of other non-food products such as those for kids and elderly or technology products and devices.”In addition^ some other industry sources said that essential lighting and home furnishing products^ kitchen essentials and related products can be brought into the ambit of essential goods at later stages.Centralised curfew passesMeanwhile^ FMCG^ retail and e-commerce companies have been raising concern about challenges around maintaining production^ supply and last-mile delivery during the ongoing lockdown period. On the one hand they are facing issues in terms of transportation of workforce^ raw material and packaging material^ on the other hand they are urging support for operating warehouses and last-mile delivery. An executive from an e-commerce firm said^ “Instead of local authorities issuing curfew passes manually at the local level in each district^ this can be done digitally through a centralised mechanism across the country.”Food supply chain vitalMeanwhile^ in a statement^ Varun Berry^ MD ^ Britannia Industries said^ “As reiterated by the Prime Minister^ essential food commodities must be made available to people at all points in time and throughout the country to ensure that people don’t indulge in panic buying. The food industry supply chain is disaggregated and dependent on inter-State movement of goods. Due to the nature of the materials^ inventories across the chain are low. If even one link in the supply chain is broken^ the country could run out of stocks of packaged food in the next 7-10 days.”“Thus it is imperative that the supply chain for food products be restored in entirety and allowed to function with adequate safety measures and police protection. The supply chain includes suppliers of raw materials and packaging materials^ food manufacturing factories^ factory workers^ transporters carrying materials and finished goods^ depots^ wholesalers^ distributors and their salesmen. Necessary permits need to be immediately issued to all of them^” he added.,26,03

As the company is into the manufacture and sale of food and beverage products^ the company is in discussions with the authorities to continue operations in the factories/distribution centres where the operations have been suspended.”Industry sources said that local level authorities need to allow production and distribution of food and other essential times to maintain supplies when large parts of the country are under a lockdown.Mayank Shah^ Category Head^ Parle Products^ said: “We are currently working with 50 per cent manpower at certain plants^ while some other plants are not operational in accordance with State and local government directives.”In a BSE filing^ Godrej Consumer Products Ltd said: “The operations in several of our locations are scaled down or shut down. The operations at some of the company’s overseas locations are also scaled down and will be operated as per the local guidelines.” Stating that the duration of this lockdown is uncertain at this point and will depend on directives issued by the respective government authorities^ it said the overall impact on the operations of the company is not immediately assessable.An ITC spokesperson stated^ “While it is extremely critical to ensure adoption of precautionary measures including hand hygiene^ social distancing and isolation during this period^ it is also important^ that during such challenging times^ essential products are made available to consumers in a safe and sustainable manner across the length and breadth of the country through continuity of supply. As various state governments issue notifications^ we are in discussions with them to ensure that manufacture and distribution of essential products is streamlined.

The widespread sell-off^ even in the leading names in the sector^ is because the COVID-19 would have a deeper impact on the sector that is highly-leveraged.

Investors looking for safe and stable funds to invest in during such times can go for Mirae Asset Large Cap.The fund is mandated to invest at least 80 per cent of its portfolio in large-cap stocks (currently those with market capitalisation of over ₹26^000 crore) as per SEBI’s classification norms.Considering that these stocks usually remain more resilient during market falls^ the scheme could provide better downside protection than funds focussed on mid- and small-cap categories^ at this juncture.Strategy and performanceMirae Asset Large Cap has undergone name changes twice in the recent past. First^ in early 2018^ when it was changed from Mirae Asset India Opportunities to Mirae Asset India Equity^ and again in May 2019 when it was rechristened Mirae Asset Large CapWhile it was benchmarked to the BSE 200 TRI earlier^ it is now benchmarked to the Nifty 100 TRI. However^ the fund’s strategy of investing predominantly in large-cap stocks has not changed over the years.Though in its earlier avatars it was usually classified as a multi-cap fund given that it carried the ‘opportunities’ tag^ the scheme stuck to investing in large-caps for a good part of its portfolio.Hence^ the fund’s long-term track record cannot entirely be dismissed and remains relevant.On this front^ it has scored well^ faring better than both the BSE 200 TRI as well as the Nifty 100 TRI in falling and volatile markets such as those in 2011^ 2013^ 2015 and 2016.In 2019 (the year of reclassification as large-cap fund)^ too^ the fund outperformed the benchmark.Apart from downside containment^ the scheme also does not miss out on rallies. Its ability to deploy 95-99 per cent of its holdings in equities without taking cash or debt calls is one reason for this. Over one-^ three- and five-year periods^ the fund has beaten both the BSE 200 TRI and Nifty 100 TRI by up to 2.2 percentage points.In these time-frames^ it has also outdone peers such as ICICI Prudential Bluechip^ Franklin India Bluechip and HDFC Top 100.The fund usually holds 50-60 stocks. While it takes 5-10 per cent exposure in its top five holdings^ the rest of the holdings are not concentrated.Portfolio choicesBanking is the preferred sector for the fund; HDFC Bank^ ICICI Bank^ SBI and Axis Bank are among the top holdings in this space. In the past year^ it has upped its banking exposure by about five percentage points.Considering the market volatility^ holdings in consumer non-durables have been raised slightly in the past year.With FMCG behemoth Hindustan Unilever recording steady performance amidst the consumption slowdown^ exposure to this stock has been upped in this period. Britannia Industries is a recent addition.The fund is also betting on a turnaround in the automobile sector sooner than later. It hiked its stake in Maruti Suzuki India in the recent past^ and added Ashok Leyland as well.Following the SEBI mandate^ the fund has held over 80 per cent in large-caps in the past year.

Not just with information on the Covid-19 outbreak^ but also on the after-effects of social distancing. From the frustration of poor connectivity and broadband to hopelessness around this uncertainty^ and from humorous takes about having to spend hours with spouses and children to the anger around hoarding and panic-buying of staples^ families and communities are trying to cope as best they can. But as families huddle together and stock up on staples^ they are also increasingly turning to home-cooked food^ a trend reflected in the spike in sales of staples and food ingredients.“We anticipate that as consumers adopt social distancing norms and keep away from eating out^ they will try to find solace in home-cooked food. With families staying at home and working from home^ in-house consumption will see a spike in staples in the coming days. We are already seeing consumers stocking up on staples in key cities such as Delhi^ Mumbai and Bengaluru due to the coronavirus outbreak^” said Ajay Motwani^ Head^ Marketing^ at Adani Wilmar Ltd^ which sells a range of staples^ including edible oils^ sugar^ pulses and rice among others. He said that the company has increased the frequency of deliveries of stocks across channels to cope with this rising demand.Another senior executive with a leading FMCG firm stated that new players are expected to venture into the staples business as the coronavirus outbreak is expected to make consumers increasingly turn to the safety of home-cooked food during these uncertain times.A permanent change?An insight note by Bain & Company on the actions CEOs need to take now advised them to get ready for changes in consumer behaviour. “Customers will change some behaviours permanently^ accelerating prior trends; bold action now can set you up for success through the downturn and beyond^"" it added.As more people have started working from home over the past few days^ the business of restaurants and institutional caterers has taken a hit. “We have experienced a significant decrease in sales because of a shutdown in Karnataka^” said Sanjay Kumar^ CEO and MD^ Elior India^ a contract caterer that serves large corporates^ including IT firms in cities such as Bengaluru^ Chennai and Hyderabad. Elior India is the subsidiary of French major Elior Group^ the fourth largest global contract caterer.“We assume the shutdown will continue for some time^ until clarity on whether there has been local community transmission is provided. At this point we see almost half of our business being impacted because of the shutdown^” Kumar said. He attributed the dip in sales to corporates opting for the work-from-home system as a precautionary measure against the coronavirus.The National Restaurants Association of India^ which represents over 5 lakh restaurants^ has asked its members to suspend operations till March 31^ keeping in mind the safety of its employees as well as guests. This comes at a time when a large number of State and local governments have asked malls^ pubs^ discotheques and spas^ among other places^ to suspend operations. The Delhi government on Thursday said all restaurants will be shut for dine-in^ while allowing takeaways and home delivery.Stocking upThe measures taken to curb the spread of the virus have indirectly resulted in a spurt in sales of staples as consumers are stocking up. It has been reported that online and offline sales of groceries and staples through neighbourhood provision stores and super markets has witnessed an increase over the past few days.E-commerce platforms are witnessing a surge in groceries and staples as well as immunity boosting products. “We have observed an increase of 80 per cent in groceries and staples in the last few days. Not only this^ immunity boosting items such as honey and ayurvedic products^ like chyawanprash^ have also seen a growth of 60 per cent^” said Albinder Dhindsa^ co-founder and CEO at Grofers said.A spokesperson for Walmart said the company has also witnessed spike in sales of a few staples and processed foods in addition to personal care and hygiene products.",21,03

Several state governments have asked shops^ malls and public places to close until further notice. With no revenue flow^ the impact on retailers^ big and small^ is significant .“Amidst a subdued demand environment^ the Indian FMCG sector saw a decline in revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter of Q3-FY20. Analysis of 101 companies shows sales growth of modest 5 per cent in Q3- FY20^ compared with 8.8 per cent in the similar period last year^” a CARE rating report on the FMCG industry suggested.On Thursday^ members of the Retailers’ Association of India’s (RAI) met a government representative to discuss the impact. It has submitted a letter seeking a few immediate relief measures from the government. “There is an urgent need for immediate economic stimulus to ensure continuity of retail stores and consumption in India^” RAI said.Firstly^ it has requested a 90-day grace period for depositing all statutory dues such as Income Tax^ Advance Tax^ GST^ ESIC and PFfor players who are supposed make payments between March 1 and June 30^ 2020.Banks shoud announce a moratorium of 120 days on payment of instalments and interest of term loans^ short-term loans^ corporate loans^ securitised loans^ bonds^ mortgages^ debentures^ general purpose loans effective from March 1^ 2020^ to June 30^ 2020.Additionally^ it also wanted the banks to mandatorily provide 25 per cent additional working capital credit lines on subsidised rates^ to tide over the shortfall given that revenue was not being generated during the lockdown period.“It is important to avoid the cascading effect of cash flow in the value chain. Additional Working Capital Credit lines to be made available till September 30^ 2020. Additional working capital credit lines to be paid back in 3 instalments between October 1^ 2020 and December 31^ 2020^” RAI said in a statement.The industry body also asked for a relaxation on NPA reporting guidelines (accounts under default for more than 90 days are reported as NPA) till December 31^ 2020 from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).,20,03

In the past couple of weeks^ retailers have seen a spike of 20-40 per cent in the sales for staples and over 400-500 per cent in those of personal hygiene products. The ‘panic buying’^ however^ is pressurising the supply chain.Several countries have gone into a state of a lockdown. The Indian government has asked people to stay indoors as much as possible.Surge in orders^ valueDomestic online grocery delivery service Grofers has seen a 75 per growth in business pan India. “We have seen a rise in both the number of orders at 45 per cent and order value at 18 per cent^” said Albinder Dhindsa^ co-founder and CEO of Grofers. “Cities like Mumbai^ Bengaulru^ Pune and Ahmedabad have seen a higher surge in business^ with nearly 80 per cent growth^ followed by Delhi-NCR and Hyderabad at 60 per cent^” he added.BigBasket^ another online grocery major^ has seen a two-fold growth in its traffic and revenue in the past couple of weeks.An industry player^ requesting anonymity^ said that their store had seen a 40 per cent growth in business.Without quantifying the surge^ a Future Group spokesperson said: “We have seen an upswing in the demand for daily essentials from our customers in certain geographies.” The group owns Big Bazaar and Easyday.BigBasket has seen an increase of 15-20 per cent in basket value^ said a spokesperson. The average ticket size for Grofers has seen an increase from ₹1^270 in February to ₹1^490 now^ Dhindsa said.According to Frost & Sullivan^ the increase in sales is a direct impact of the closure of malls and the paranoia surrounding the coronavirus. “With people opting not to venture out or reducing stepping out of home^ online sales will increase^” said Rohit Kulkarni^ Principal Consultant^ Visionary Science Practice^ Frost & Sullivan.Sanitizers^ masks^ soaps in demandDuring the SARS outbreak^ in 2002-04^ laundry sanitisers saw a 90 per cent CAGR in retail sales value in China. Such a drastic increase in demand can be expected in this scenario^ too^ according to EuromonitorThe sales of face masks^ sanitisers and gloves have soared in India. The demand for these protective products has skyrocketed to the tune of 400-500 per cent in the last 15 days.Sandip Chhettri^ COO of b2b platform TradeIndia.com^ said: “In the last 15 days^ the demand for sanitisers has increased 559 per cent; face masks 334 per cent; hand wash 81 per cent and disposable gloves 66 per cent.”Along with the mask^ “the demand for mask making machines has also surged by 250 per cent^” he said.For Grofers^ personal hygiene as a category has seen the biggest surge^ including sanitisers by 400 per cent^ hand washes by 120 per cent^ soaps by 70 per cent^ followed by floor cleaners. “High demand has been observed in disposable categories such as toilet paper^ tissues and wet wipes^” said Dhindsa.Staples categoryThe staples category has also seen a spike for both online and offline players. “Besides sanitisers and staples^ we are seeing a huge hike in the ready-to-eat segment^” said the industry player quoted above.Grofers has observed a spike in the sales of essential commodities like atta^ sugar^ pulses and rice. Also^ products that are said to boost immunity have seen a 60 per cent sales growth. The company has discontinued promotions for essential commodities.According to a BigBasket spokesperson^ the company’s private label in the staples category is seeing an increase in sales. There is also a spike in the sales for fruits and vegetables.Panic buyingLast week^ a video on social media went viral where three women could be seen fighting over a pack of toilet roll in a supermarket. Eventually^ the store had to ask the three women to leave without shopping.This reflects a clear case of ‘panic buying’^ said industry players and experts.“Paranoia is easiest to set in when it comes to health-related issues^ especially with a situation like Covid-19^” said Frost & Sullivan’s Kulkarni.Harsha Razdan^ Partner and Head - Consumer Markets and Internet Business^ KPMG in India^ added that when people are guided to social distancing^ it is logical to expect them to over-stock on essentials such as personal hygiene products^ staples and packaged foods. “The existing uncertainty around how the pandemic shapes up may result in a blip in spend by consumers in these categories^” he explained.“In the last couple of days we have seen panic buying across a number of cities and categories^” agreed Grofers’ Dhindsa.According to him^ a lot of people are also trying to game the system to acquire items and hoard them.“We are taking a hard approach to hoarding of essential commodities. We are working proactively to block them and make sure essential supplies are available to genuine customers^” he added.Supply chain and deliveryThis panic buying may impact the supply chain and delivery time lines in the future.According to Kulkarni^ prices of surgical masks have increased almost 10-fold from ₹10 per mask to ₹80-100. E-commerce companies like Amazon and BigBasket have a supply shortage of sanitisers.“Although we faced some disruption in the last three days^ we have taken corrective action and have geared up for supplies to meet the increased demand. We will face some constraints for a few more days because it takes time to build capacity in terms of storage^ delivery fleet and people^” said a BigBasket spokesperson.Though Grofers has not seen any supply issue so far^ the company is bumping up capabilities and hiring more people to ensure the availability of all essential goods. “We are working with more manufacturing partners to scale up the supply^ while requesting customers to opt for considerate shopping so that shelves remain stocked for everyone^” Dhindsa said.,20,03

Industry experts are also anticipating job losses as a result of the ensuing economic slowdown.According to senior HR consultants^ while IT companies have some experience in enabling such practices^ a majority of the industries in India are just not open to the idea of working from home as a culture.“IT companies have the necessary systems and security features in place that allow employees to opt for remote working. Usually they may be having 20-30 per cent of their employees working from home at any point in time. Now it could be well over 90 per cent. But implementing the same for services and manufacturing companies would be very difficult^” RP Yadav^ CMD^ Genius Consultants^ told BusinessLine.Even if companies were to give their employees laptops^ one big challenge would be to make available however^ making server connectivity. Besides^ there could be security threats^ particularly in cases where a lot of data is handled. Even IT companies may not be adequately prepared for employees working from home on such a large-scale basis.However^ organisations are likely to ensure that advanced security measures are put in place to maintain data confidentiality and the traditional physical gatekeeping methods could be replaced by virtual gatekeeping^ said Anjali Raghuvanshi^ Chief People Officer^ Randstad India.Companies gearing upIn the wake of Covid-19 outbreak^ Capgemini has provisioned additional laptops to enhance remote working and work-from-home. Tech Mahindra has relaxed the work-from-home policy for its associates. The company has also advised employees to adequately leverage technologies such as tele presence and video conferencing^ said Harshvendra Soin^ Chief People Officer^ Tech Mahindra.FMCG major ITC has also advised offices in some locations to put in place and execute “contingency plans” at the earliest including work-from-home arrangements.“Business continuity plans are being put in place to address any potential contingencies and for social distancing. All businesses have been advised to set up a core contingency management team^” Amitav Mukherji^ Head of Corporate Human Resources^ ITC Ltd.Tata Steel has instructed its employees to refrain from using any mode of public transport and is encouraging them to pool-in their private vehicles for commuting to and from workplace^ wherever feasible. In case this is not feasible^ employees will be extended work-from-home or special leave as applicable^ a Tata Steel spokesperson said. The company has also advised all expecting mothers to work from home or avail special leave with immediate effect^ till further notice.Mynd Solutions^ which already has a business continuity plan in place for the security and continuity of services and data availability on the cloud^ has also started focusing on potential scenarios and ways to mitigate the same in the light of the ongoing coronavirus situation^ its CEO and Co-founder^ Vivek Misra said.Fear of job lossesThe slowdown in sales and sluggish demand could result in job losses. A number of sectors such as aviation^ hospitality^ tourism^ and consumer goods^ are likely to witness job losses. Fresh hirings are also likely to be hit.“Recruitments have been frozen as there is a lot of uncertainty. At any point in time^ we have a mandate for 1^500-2^000 recruitments^ but nearly 50 per cent of the companies have asked us to put it on hold^” Yadav said.Given the scenario^ it will take at least a year or two for the job market to return to normal.Paradigm shiftAccording to Neeti Sharma^ Senior Vice President^ TeamLease Services^ one of the key takeaways of the current situation would be that corporates will start becoming more open to the concept of remote working.“This will also open doors for more technology-enabled working^ whether it is tools^ infrastructure^ connectivity^ equipments…. a lot of that will open up from the corporate standpoint. There will also be a big shift in terms of being prepared for such eventuality – this was a once in a lifetime occurance and we were not prepared. Corporates will look at putting in place business continuity plan to take into account such eventuality rather than letting it come as a rude shock^” Sharma said.This will trigger changes not just in the minds of employers but also employees who will learn to understand and respect the discipline that working from home demands. Organisations will also work on tighter monitoring and governance mechanisms for remote working and ensure that systems and processes are more fine-tuned^ thereby creating the right culture.,18,03

But key FMCG players on Wednesday stated they have adequate stocks available for such products.Creating awarenessSunil Kataria^ CEO (India & SAARC)^ Godrej Consumer Products Ltd said^ “We have ramped up production of Protekt hand wash and sanitisers in our units as well as through our vendor partner units. We have also started a strong digital campaign on Godrej Protekt to create awareness about the regime of washing hands regularly as it helps in preventing spread of viruses.” He said the intent of such a campaign is to educate consumers on prevention of spread of COVID-19.A company spokesperson for Hindustan Unilever said the company has adequate stocks of hand sanitisers to meet the spike in demand. “Given the surge in demand for hygiene products^ we have redoubled our efforts to ensure consumers have access to products that keep them safe such as Lifebuoy hand sanitisers and hand wash. While certain pockets may witness a shortage due to sudden demand^ overall^ we have adequate stock of hand sanitisers and are geared to meet the increased demand^” the spokesperson added.Companies have also begun strategic campaigns to raise awareness about handwashing^ at a time when the globe is battling with the virus outbreak.Stating that there is adequate supply of “Savlon hygiene products in the market^” a spokespeson for ITC added that^ “Savlon continues to focus on enhancing awareness about hand hygiene and urges consumers to maintain good hygiene practices.”Companies are also stepping up targeted efforts on digital media platforms to address queries of consumers on prevention of Coronavirus. Mukesh Mishra^ Marketing Head-Healthcare^ Dabur India Ltd said^“Dabur is running a series of awareness campaigns across digital platforms^ social Media and mainstream media to educate the public about how to keep themselves safe from Coronavirus. We are also organising a Q&A sessions^ particularly for mothers^ with Ayurvedic doctors on digital media platforms to address their queries regarding Corona Virus and how to keep their families protected from it.”Besides shortages^ some consumers also took to social media to report price hikes in products such as hand sanitisers and masks. CH Krishna^ President^ Federation of All India Distributors Association said^ “We are cautioning retailers not to take advantage of the prevailing situation by hiking prices of products like hand sanitisers which come with clear MRPs on their packaging labels. While there has been a big surge in demand and shortages are being reported for hand sanitisers^ we believe the companies are well-equipped to meet the demand.”However^ he pointed out that keeping track of prices of products such as masks is tough as many do not come with a MRP.Philipe Haydon^ CEO^ The Himalaya Drug Company said^ “In light of the Coronavirus spread that the country is facing^ we have taken specific measures to ensure that we are able to match up to this high demand of hand-washes and sanitizers. We are ramping up our production to match up to this country-wide demand that will help people take precautionary measures. Alongside this^ we have an awareness program running across govt. schools in Karnataka to educate children on appropriate ways of washing hands and keeping infections away.,05,03
2020-02-24,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/news-analysis/amid-covid-19-gloom-some-healthy-signs-for-india-inc/article30896676.ece,The Hindu BusinessLine,Amid Covid-19 gloom^ some healthy signs for India Inc,Could there be a silver lining for India Inc. amidst the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak in China? The news flow so far has been largely negative with supply-chain disruptions and adverse impact being foreseen for many sectors^ including pharma^ auto^ electronics^ consumer durables^ mobile phones^ tourism^ and gems and jewellery. But a few Indian sectors and companies could also gain^ say some research houses.Stepping inImport substitution could help some sectors. A recent Crisil report says that in ceramics and plastics^ Indian domestic manufacturers are expected to benefit with import volumes from China reducing. For instance^ India imports 44 per cent of its total plastics from China^ and a reduction in cheap imports could benefit India’s plastic industry. Emkay Global^ in its report^ says that some pharma players such as Divi’s Laboratories and Granules India with the capacity to supply APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) could gain from an expected rise in the price of these ingredients.There could also be opportunities to fill the void left by China in some export markets. The Crisil report says that India’s steel^ paper^ leather and textile ready-made garments segments have a window of opportunity to expand exports^ with China’s exports being impacted. For instance^ Indian leather exporters are operating at about 60 per cent capacity utilisation; these entities^ therefore^ have the capacity to absorb any sudden influx of orders from the US and EU players. But not all Indian sectors can benefit from this opportunity^ given their capacity constraints or capability issues^ the report adds.Cost benefitThe dip in commodity prices due to China’s demand destruction worries could also help some Indian companies. The report by Emkay Global points out that the cooling-off in crude oil prices should benefit FMCG companies such as Asian Paints^ Berger Paints and Pidilite Industries^ and tyre firms such as Apollo Tyres that use crude-oil based raw materials. It says that oil marketing companies such as Indian Oil^ HPCL and BPCL could benefit from higher refining and marketing margins.Gas utilities such as Gujarat Gas and GSPL could gain from higher volume offtake due to lower LNG prices^ while battery-makers such as Exide Industries and Amara Raja Batteries should see improved margins on lower lead costs^ the report adds.Early days yetWhile there could be some beneficiaries in India Inc^ it may still be early to gauge the full impact of the coronavirus. News about infections/fatalities rising in South Korea^ Italy and Iran is trickling in. If this continues and the virus becomes a global pandemic^ the impact on India Inc could get much more complicated.Also^ the second-order impact of the disruptions needs to be seen. A worst-case scenario could play out if India sees an increase in the number of infections. That could lead to lockdowns and contraction in both supply and demand^ akin to China^ and exacerbate an already challenging economic situation. Fortunately^ incidences of the disease in India have been low — in low single-digits — so far. Hopefully^ as some predict^ the virus will fade away with the advent of summer in the next couple of months.,24,02
