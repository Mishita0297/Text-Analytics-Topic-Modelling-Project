Some dished out new product lines by the dozen to tap into new opportunities such as sanitizers^ although the verdict on this strategy is still out.Industry leader Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) said around 80% of its portfolio^ comprising health^ hygiene and nutrition products^ expanded 6% in the June quarter. But the remaining 20% of its portfolio^ including skincare^ colour cosmetics^ ice cream and food solutions products fared miserably. Overall^ HUL’s domestic consumer growth declined by 7%^ after adjusting for the impact of the GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd merger.View Full Image Gainers and losers“For HUL^ the gains from a shift from the unorganized category are limited compared to some other firms^ say^ Britannia Industries^ which benefitted from the shutdown of local bakeries during the lockdown. Simply put^ HUL’s portfolio isn’t as ‘covid-friendly^’ owing to the discretionary nature of some of its products. Moreover^ given its large size^ the contribution from new launches during the June quarter was much smaller vis-à-vis other companies^" said Varun Lohchab^ head of institutional research at HDFC Securities.Britannia capitalized on the rising in-home consumption effectively^ extracting a neat 26.7% year-on-year growth in consolidated revenue. Similarly^ Tata Consumer Products saw a 13% revenue growth^ helped by increased in-home consumption. ITC’s food segment also performed well. However^ Nestle India Ltd’s domestic revenue growth for the June quarter slowed to 2.6%^ compared to 10% each in the previous three quarters.Commenting on Nestle’s relative underperformance in the food category^ analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said^ “We note that other FMCG companies smartly leveraged third party distribution (including startups)^ rationalized SKUs (tock-keeping units) to drive cost savings^ and cut down on trade incentives/promotions (aided gross margins)."The broking firm said Nestle was also affected by its higher urban salience. Nestle said it was hurt by production disruptions across factories and sharply lower demand in the out-of-home channel.Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd’s revenue drop was contained at 4% as the oral care category remained unaffected by covid. Marico Ltd’s revenues fell 11% as India business was weaker. Godrej Consumer Products Ltd’s (GCPL) consolidated revenue was flattish as India and Indonesia fared well but Africa lagged. Its domestic household insecticides segment outshined but soaps and hair colours were subdued. Dabur India Ltd’s healthcare portfolio did well even as foods suffered due to lower demand for cold beverages.Companies have indicated that rural markets have performed better. “Given the lower spread of the virus and tailwinds from good monsoon/ government spending^ rural and smaller towns led recovery^ even as large cities lagged^" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 10 August.Firms launched new products suited to the pandemic across food^ hygiene and health categories. Dabur had more than 50 launches in the past few months. New product contribution improved to 6% of Dabur’s June quarter revenues. GCPL had about 45 launches.True^ launches help tap into new opportunities^ but investors would probably be better off keeping expectations low. “These are (likely) primary sales (firm selling to distributors) and consumer acceptance is still untested somewhat^" wrote ICICI Securities Ltd’s analysts in a report on 6 August. “We have a concern on the bunching up and timing of these launches as retailers are not ready to stock new products (per market checks) and consumer is hesitant to try new products along with fewer opportunities for consumers to browse and buy."Meanwhile^ investors have taken things too far in rewarding the covid winners. Shares of Tata Consumer touched a new 52-week high on NSE on Friday. The Britannia stock is about 20% higher than its pre-covid highs in February. Overall^ the Nifty FMCG index has gained 4.9% so far in 2020^ compared to a 6.5% drop in the Nifty 50 index.The high valuations of most consumer firms may well find support in these uncertain times even if the road ahead is rocky^ an analyst said seeking anonymity.“Overall^ for the FMCG sector^ sporadic lockdowns in some areas in July may have hit the recovery rate in the current (September) quarter. Consumers are still cautious about spending on non-necessities and demand for out-of-home will remain under pressure in FY21^" added Lohchab.Although it is encouraging that some discretionary demand appears to be recovering. “Firms pointed to a sequential recovery in skincare^ haircare^ etc.^ toward the latter part of June quarter^" said Jefferies’ analysts.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
2020-08-11,https://www.livemint.com//news/india/covid-survey-90-of-consumers-making-lasting-changes-to-how-they-live-work-11597146722679.html,LiveMint,Covid survey: 90% of consumers making lasting changes to how they live^ work,NEW DELHI: Covid-19 has led to changes in consumer behaviour and for some in India^ these change such as turning more cost conscious^ making healthier and environmentally sustainable choices^ visiting local stores^ shopping online are likely to stick around even after the threat of the pandemic is gone^ according to findings of Accenture’s COVID-19 Consumer Pulse research.This change in turn will have an impact on the consumer goods and retail industries.The research surveyed 2^500 consumers in India between March and June^ and those surveyed were part of the 45^000 consumers surveyed globally by the firm.A majority of those surveyed in India are making permanent changes to the way they consume^ work^ and live^ the report said. As a result^ "there is is no going back to the pre-pandemic world for consumer brands.""Consumers are now focused on their most basic needs while cutting back on non-essentials. They are more mindful of what they’re buying^ striving to limit food waste^ shopping more cost consciously and are making healthier and environmentally sustainable choices^" according to findings of the survey released on Monday.Indian shoppers took to panic buying and shopping for packaged food and health and hygiene products as an outcome of the pandemic.With concerns around personal hygiene exacerbated^ nearly 50% of those surveyed said they are increasing their purchases of personal hygiene products. "Personal hygiene habits have changed dramatically^ with people hand-washing more often and cleaning surfaces at home more frequently^" according to the survey results.The pandemic has also piqued consumer interest in local^ neighborhood stores while helping with swift adoption of online shopping."Consumers also remain hesitant to step out of their safety zones to resume previous consumption patterns^ are buying local^ and embracing digital commerce. The survey found that the pandemic is causing more people to shop for groceries online^" the report said.Some of these changes are set to find a permanent spot in consumer habits especially as several Indians have taken to shopping online thanks to the covid-19 induced lockdowns.“The demand for local products^ digital commerce and omni-channel services such a home delivery^ chat features^ and virtual consultations is surging^ and is likely to endure beyond this crisis^" the report said. Interestingly^ 74% of Indian consumers are buying locally sourced products. Nearly 80% of those surveyed want to shop at neighborhood stores.In fact^ 75% of consumers said that they're being more cost-conscious when shopping for products.The pandemic has also shifted consumer loyalty^ with consumers now veering more towards brands that are sustainable and healthier for them. Trust is a key factor too."The pandemic has taken a toll on brand loyalty and as consumers make more socially and environmentally sustainable and healthy choices^ consumer goods companies must tailor their offerings accordingly and refresh their brand promise to meet these new requirements^" said Anurag Gupta^ managing director and lead^ strategy and consulting^ Accenture in India.With the house now becoming the nerve centre—with more people working and studying from home—consumers also took to learning new things^ DIY activities^ cooking and spent more time on entertainment^ leading to a surge in content viewership across platforms.Moreover^ media consumption has increased^ 70% are watching more video streaming content and social media usage has gone up by 75%. “Staying in is the new going out. 34% people plan to increase the amount they work from home in the future….Consumers are finding new ways to fill the extra time that many now have at home. Socializing at home is the preferred option in the next 6 months and 71% consumers are connecting virtually with friends^" the Accenture report said.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

For the quarter ended 30 June^ fabric care sales declined 23.8% especially as demand for its Ujala fabric whitener and Crisp and Shine cleaning products fell.Kamath said while it was hard to predict demand going forward^ if the country resists a second wave of infections and localised lockdowns^ then demand for packaged consumer goods could touch pre-covid levels.He warned that discretionary^ non-essential spends could take a beating while consumers spend more on health and hygiene products.In the fiscal first quarter^ the company’s consolidated sales were down 2.4% at ₹433 crores^ while net profit rose 33.8% to ₹50 crore.Kamath said consumption of health and hygiene products remains intact especially as more people spend longer hours at home.“The consumption has not come down^ if you look across categories^ consumption was more because people were sitting at home during the lockdown period^ eating and washing more utensils. And again^ we have seen house helps were not around and husbands were washing the utensils—the insight is very clear that men have used more dishwash product because they don't know how to use Pril or Exo^ so they have used half more to clean dishes. So consumption has gone up for dishwasher—the category has grown^" he said.Earlier this year^ the company launched hand sanitizers and face wash under the Margo brand.It also started operations at its plant in Pithampur^ Madhya Pradesh^ in July to boost output of its dishwashing brands Pril and Exo.Kamath said the plant will help service markets up north and expand production by nearly 40%.India’s fast moving consumer goods makers saw an unprecedented quarter - one that helped drive demand for cookies^ floor cleaners and packaged tea but also saw shoppers shun personal care and beauty products as they stayed put at home. In all^ market researcher Nielsen expects India’s FMCG market to post flattish growth in the current calendar year.Nielsen maintained that April and May dragged growth rates for the sector^ with June seeing some signs of recovery. It expects the sector to post growth rates registered in the month of June going forward.Kamath said that for Jyothy Labs^ traditional trade channels were back to recording growth after seeing restricted operations at the beginning of the lockdown^ but modern trade channels were slowing down.E-commerce sales^ on the other hand^ doubled during the quarter^ albeit on a lower base of 2-3%.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

Executives at top FMCG companies said the disruption caused by the pandemic has prompted them to look at redundancies in operations and reduce the time taken to roll out new products and reach markets.FMCG firms in India rely on extensive market research and a massive network of distributors and small shops to ensure products reach shoppers^ but the lockdown upended their links to the markets.However^ with a surge in demand for packaged foods and personal hygiene products^ companies have set up teams^ created links with hyperlocal delivery partners^ and helped get their products to stores.While not all associations and learnings will stick^ especially as markets gradually open up and stocks start to move^ several firms will look at imbibing some of these changes in the way they function.Chennai-based CavinKare^ which launched new products such as sanitizers and a vegetable cleaner in record time^ said it could look at cutting timelines for new product launches and even narrow lengthy test marketing processes going forward. The maker of Chik shampoo typically takes 18 months to launch a new product.“Even before covid^ one of the endeavours of the company was to cut this time frame. We had actually initiated internal action to be able to look at whether we are able to cut the period to a substantially lower time. To the extent that some of the categories we’ve been able to do in a month^ that’s also probably to do with the formulation of the products. But now we are looking at the time frame where we can quickly crunch the 18-to-24 month period down to much shorter periods^" said Venkatesh Vijayaraghavan^ director and chief executive officer-personal care and alliance at CavinKare. He said the firm allowed cross-functional teams to work together^ thereby reducing duplication.“One of the things that this particular experience of covid has done is bring the entire cross-functional teams^ i.e. marketing^ production^ packaging^ supply chains and R&D together^ so we’re able to crunch timelines^ eliminate some of the duplications that happened^" he said.Covid also prompted firms to ramp up supplies online and forge tie-ups with hyperlocal delivery partners and even assist retailers by opening up helplines as the lockdown crippled the movement of goods.More such direct-to-consumer^ online-to-offline and vice versa^ and hybrid models are likely to come into play^ Russell Reynolds Associates^ an advisory firm^ said in a research note this week.Moreover^ there has also been a quick adoption of e-commerce channels to buy groceries. Typically^ 87% of FMCG sales in India come from traditional or kirana stores. But covid is likely to change that.Beverage maker Coca-Cola India said adoption of digital tools—both remote working as well as scaling up presence on e-commerce^ at a time when out-of-home consumption of beverages remains disrupted —has been accelerated.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

June registered 4.5% year-on-year value growth^ while April and May fell 27%.Interestingly in the second quarter^ growth in rural and small towns outpaced that in metros.In June^ rural markets^ that account for 36% of FMCG sales in India^ grew three times of all India FMCG growth^ researchers at Nielsen said.“We are expecting some growth in Q3^ but we are expecting more growth in Q4 than Q3^ as festive time will be more in swing in Q4.

2020-07-29,https://www.livemint.com//market/mark-to-market/britannia-cashed-in-on-packaged-food-demand-in-june-qtr-but-nestle-fell-behind-11595999468485.html,LiveMint,Unlike Britannia^ Nestle fails to cash in on the demand for packaged food,Opportunity knocks but once. And^ the covid-induced opportunity was the spike in demand for packaged food. In that sense^ Nestle India Ltd has missed the boat^ but peer Britannia Industries Ltd was able to capitalize on it. Nestle’s June-quarter year-on-year revenue growth of about 2% fell short of analysts’ estimates. In contrast^Britannia’s 26.4% revenue growth was slightly better than the Street’s optimistic estimates^ following the company’s indications prior to the results that the quarter was shaping up well.Nestle maintains that its sales were adversely impacted due to the lockdown^ leading to production disruption across factories. Further^ demand in the “out-of-home" channel saw a considerable decline. Nestle derived 4.4% of its operating revenues from exports^ which fell by 9%. Domestic sales contributed 95.6% of revenues and increased by 2.6% over the same period last year.View Full Image Not delicious enoughNote^ the food and beverage segments of Hindustan Unilever Ltd and ITC Ltd^ too^ performed relatively better in the June quarter. Nestle’s performance in the March quarter had raised hopes as well. Analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities said: “Given this (strong March quarter) and^ in view of Nestle’s portfolio and execution strength^ we hadn’t expected any supply-chain issues; to that extent^ supply chain issues in Maggi surprised."Kotak analysts wrote in a report on 28 July: “We note that other FMCG companies smartly leveraged third-party distribution (including startups)^ rationalized SKUs to drive cost savings and cut down on trade incentives or promotions (aided gross margins). Nestle’s higher urban salience hurt as well." Meanwhile^ Nestle’s e-commerce channel increased by 122% in the June quarter^ and now contributes 3.6% to domestic sales. Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said: “Earnings before interest^ tax depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin expanded 80 basis points year-on-year to 24.9%." One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. “Margins however came to the rescue and allowed Nestle to meet our forecast^" it added.A sharp decline in other expenses boosted Ebitda. This looks good considering gross margin declined by 180 bps owing to inflation in dairy inputs.Even so^ the subdued revenue growth was more disappointing. After its results^ on Wednesday^ the Nestle stock fell 3%. The company has restored its eight factories almost to their pre-covid manufacturing capabilities. With growth momentum back^ it would be interesting to watch the extent to which Nestle can offset the demand loss it had incurred in the first half of 2020. Nestle’s financial year ends in December and the June quarter is its second.While the firm is well-placed to ride the packaged food consumption theme^ the stock’s expensive valuations leave little room for an upside. Nestle’s shares trade at a valuation multiple of nearly 77 times trailing 12 months earnings and that’s hardly cheap.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

2020-07-28,https://www.livemint.com//companies/news/covid-helps-reckitt-benckiser-s-dettol-soaps-win-market-share-in-india-11595944594739.html,LiveMint,Covid helps Reckitt Benckiser's Dettol soaps win market share in India,Packaged consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser’s (RB) Dettol soap bar became the country’s number one selling soap brand by value share^ claimed the company^ riding on the increased demand for personal hygiene products in the countryThe maker of Dettol disinfectants^ Harpic toilet cleaners and Veet hair removal cream^ posted a “high single digit (revenue) growth" in India during the first half of the year^ the company’s top management said as RB announced its half-yearly and second quarter results on Tuesday.“It (India) did grow in high single digits (on a like-to-like basis) in this period. Dettol^ a power brand in India^ achieved the number one share in soaps in India for the first time^" Laxman Narasimhan^ Chief Executive Officer^ at the company said in a post earnings call with analysts on Tuesday.In India^ RB sells various products under Dettol such as surface disinfectants^ soaps^ antiseptic liquid^ hand sanitisers^ kitchen dish cleaning gels and body wash among others. Covid has helped accelerate frequency and adoption of cleaning products such as soaps and hand washes.At over ₹20^000 crore^ bar soaps remain the most dominant hygiene category in India.Hindustan Unilever Ltd. leads the market with Lifebuoy and Lux soaps followed by Wipro Consumer Care’s Santoor and Godrej Consumer Products’ Godrej No. 1 brands which are among the top sellers in the market. HUL and Wipro go by market researcher Kantar’s volume share data on soaps.Lifebuoy is among the country’s largest selling brand by volumes—driven by its mass-market positioning and reach in rural markets. RB’s Dettol^ on the other hand^ is priced at a premium.In the first half^ the Dettol brand grew strongly globally^ up 62% compared to the same period in 2019^ with growth in both developed and emerging markets^ led by covid-19 demand fuelling greater product penetration and frequency of use; Dettol became the number one soap brand in India^ the United Arab Emirates^ Saudi Arabia and Malaysia^ the company said in its earnings release.“It boils down certainly to the fact that there are tailwinds that you get from covid in India but it also boils down to some execution improvements we are seeing in both the health segments as well as the hygiene segments. What we are seeing there is a focus on distribution^ a focus on ensuring availability^ which hasn’t been easy^ given all the lockdowns in India at various places and at various points^" Narasimhan said.However^ gains made by RB could be short-term^ said an analyst speaking to Mint on the condition of anonymity.For the three months ended June 30^ the company reported a 10.5% jump in like-to-like sales as global demand for personal and home cleaning products—Lizol^ Dettol and Sagrotan—surged. India saw growth in May and June as lock-down eased^ although the outlook on emerging markets remains uncertain^ the company said.The company continues to drive penetration that will help drive category building^ especially in markets like India. “If you look at India^ we have seen increase in points of distribution and the overall India business grew in high-single digits in this time^" he said.Narasimhan said the company also actively focused on brand building. For instance^ its Dettol India hand-wash challenge launched in April^ on the now banned TikTok app^ received in excess of 120 billion views.Not just Dettol^ the company also saw demand for its home cleaning brands Lizol and Harpic go up.“So what we are doing there is not just a focus on financial results per say^ in the short term^ but also building the equity of the brand. And the Dettol brand equity is at one of its highest points. We are also heartened by the progress we are seeing on Lizol and Harpic in India and the continued scale up of that business^" he said.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
2020-07-22,https://www.livemint.com//opinion/columns/fmcg-firms-await-recovery-in-the-hospitality-sector-11595435388122.html,LiveMint,Opinion | FMCG firms await recovery in the hospitality sector,The latest report on consumer behaviour by market researcher Nielsen explains how cooking at home is now almost embedded in Indian minds^ thanks to being cooped up indoors for months during the pandemic-induced lockdown. The discovery of the kitchen^ it said^ is driven by critical needs to be healthy^ safe and economical given the uncertainties around covid-19. Even though they find cooking time-consuming^ people have shed their inhibitions about rustling up meals as they look for quick^ authentic recipes online.The same report talks of a bearish consumer attitude towards expenditure on dining out and travel. Such a mindset^ which stems both from the fear of contracting the infection and job insecurity^ has dealt a body blow to the hotels^ restaurants and cafes (HoReCa) business of fast-moving consumer goods companies.Arvind Mediratta^ MD and CEO^ METRO Cash and Carry India^ said HoReCa was the first sector to shut its doors to customers^ even before the lockdown started. The wholesaler^ whose primary customers are kiranas and the hospitality sector^ admitted that its sales started declining in early March. Hotels and restaurants stopped entertaining customers as gatherings were restricted. Even caterers serving weddings and institutions lost business as schools^ colleges and offices shut down.Even though the Worldpanel division of market research firm Kantar tracks only household consumption^ its managing director K. Ramakrishnan said the complete closure of HoReCa will definitely affect FMCG firms as food comprises 70% of the total volume for the industry. “Atta is a big component for snacks and biscuits^ so is dairy. HoReCa is a subset of out-of-home consumption^ which is down too^" he said.Consequently^ companies in the food segment^ such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL)^ Adani Wilmar^ Nestle India Ltd^ ITC Ltd^ Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)^ the owner of dairy brand Amul^ and numerous other big and small firms that feed HoReCa^ saw their businesses contract. In its June-quarter earnings^ HUL said its ice-creams^ food solutions and vending businesses^ which are driven primarily by out-of-home consumption^ were massively impacted by the lockdown and closure of restaurants and eateries.HoReCa customers buy fresh and frozen fruits^ vegetables and meats^ groceries^ commodities^ processed foods^ confectionery ingredients and beverages^ among others^ from both MNCs as well as small^ local players. METRO^ which deals in many brands in these categories^ saw its business dip. “HoReCa is facing a dip of 60-70% on pre-covid levels^" said Mediratta^R.S. Sodhi^ managing director^ GCMMF^ which sells dairy products to the HoReCa segment as well^ said several cheese manufacturers in Maharashtra who supplied only to the hospitality sector^ especially restaurants and fast-food chains^ have been wiped out with their closure. Amul was better placed as only 10-12% of its total business comes from HoReCa^ he said.“This segment has not revived. It is a loss for us as well^ but it’s something we can bear because household consumption in many categories has grown really well^" he said. GCMMF saw 30-35% growth in household consumption of cheese during the lockdown. For Amul^ 12-15% of milk sales^ 20% of paneer sales and 70% of fresh cream sales comes from the hospitality sector. But Sodhi claims what Amul lost in HoReCa^ it gained in household consumption.METRO has been proactive in generating additional business by tying up with government and defence services and hospitals. It has also partnered with online food aggregators and logistics firms such as Swiggy^ Dineout and others supplying inventories to HoReCa.From his understanding of working closely with the sector^ Mediratta said it may take about six months for recovery and about one year to reach pre-covid levels of business. However^ those pivoting to cloud kitchens^ takeaways and home deliveries will recover faster.

(GCPL) that sells the Protekt brand of hygiene products said it is in talks for B-to-B tie-ups and ITC has started providing Savlon branded products to its hotels and some airlines.While such B-to-B sales are a low margin business^ companies are expecting orders to go up as and when more businesses open up going forward.“Institutional business will be large segment as India opens up as offices^ malls and hotels open^ it will be a new segment which will become big^" Sunil Kataria^ CEO^ India and SAARC^ GCPL told reporters last week.The lockdown has impacted institutional business for several large companies—especially food companies—that provide bulk supplies to hotels and restaurants. But for companies selling sanitizers^ soaps and surface disinfectants^ large orders are likely to firm up as businesses resume^ spurring demand for more cleaning products.Last week^ GCPL expanded Protekt to over a dozen new products extending the sanitization and hand-wash brand to multipurpose disinfectant solutions^ air and surface disinfectant spray^ and anti-bacterial wipes^ among other such products.The company^ said a top executive at the firm^ is in talks for large tie-ups.“We have multiple contracts which our institutional teams keep doing. We are in talks with airlines as well as hotels. But apart from that—there are a few other chains in other sectors where we have got some kind of tie-up that has happened two weeks ago^" Kataria said without divulging details.“Institutional sales for us has not been a big focus area^ but now with this (covid)^ things could change^" he added.“At the same time^ I’d like to mention that institutional business is also a price sensitive business where^ while there is a brand play^ but there is also a very large competitive play."ITC has also provided Savlon sanitizers to some leading airlines^ a company spokeswoman told Mint.“As part of its WeAssure Programme^ ITC Hotels has partnered with Savlon to ensure protection from a wide range of viruses and bacteria. Savlon’s trusted knowhow and its range of products in germ protection have been integrated into the WeAssure initiative^" the company spokeswoman added.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

2020-07-19,https://www.livemint.com//industry/retail/intermittent-lockdowns-in-several-states-disrupt-fmcg-firms-momentum-july-output-11595137686252.html,LiveMint,Intermittent lockdowns in several states disrupt FMCG firms' momentum^ July output,NEW DELHI : FMCG companies^ which saw sales recovering to pre- COVID-19 levels in June^ are uncertain if the same momentum could be maintained in July due to intermittent and localised lockdowns in several parts of the country which have impacted manufacturing and supply chains.As the industry oscillate between lockdown and reopening in various states^ companies such as Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) and ITC are banking on inventories stocked up to maintain supplies to the market.They expect an impact on their July production^ with some of their local production units due to restriction of labour movements apart from their warehouses as well as vendors coming into the intermittent lockdown zones^ which are being declared by states to curb the spread of COVID-19 cases."This is a very tricky situation and there is no debate in that this intermittent lockdown^ which is happening^ is creating a disturbance in some kind of rhythm which we have got into the supply chain^" GCPL chief executive - India and SAARC Sunil Kataria told PTI.According to him^ this is a "very fluid situation" as "uncertainty is very high" about a particular area or region^ which would be put under lockdown by the authorities."These are not a uniform lockdown. The earlier lockdown was a pan India lockdown^ one lockdown for all. Now^ these lockdowns are very dynamic and fluid as they are happening in very select pockets. Now you do not know about the pockets or any unit of yours^ which would be impacted or not. Moreover^ some are for 7 days^ 10 days or 15 days and uncertainty is quite high^" Kataria said.Another FMCG maker ITC too expects new lockdowns to create disruptions in terms of production and supply."The lockdown announced in different states^ which is required to contain the increasing spread of the pandemic^ can cause temporary and localised disruptions to manufacturing and the supply chain^" said a ITC spokesperson.FMCG players had started to re-establish their supply chain in May and gradually ramped up as markets reopened^ which had created a momentum."But now suddenly^ the second wave of lockdown has hit us^ it will definitely create a disturbance. We had hoped it to not have happened^" Kataria said.When asked if there could be an impact on the company's July production^ he said^ "By end of June^ (the company had reached) around 85 to 90 per cent production but July would be different because of several lockdowns happening."He^ however^ said GCPL has a "decent amount of inventory to take care of that" disruption.Similarly^ the ITC spokesperson said the Kolkata-headquartered company is taking efforts to ensure adequate stock availability of its FMCG products in the market across these states.According to industry experts^ FMCG companies should be ready to handle the impact of such localised and intermittent lockdowns as these are likely to continue till there is a decline of the COVID-19 cases in the country."FMCG companies should be prepared to manage these disruptions by closely watching the COVID-19 case trends across key markets and planning their stocking and production accordingly to address these uncertainties better^" said EY Partner and National leader (Consumer Products and Retail) Pinakiranjan Mishra.Another aspect of these localised lockdowns is the impact on labour movement to factories."We were going for local labour force as migrant labourers were not available. But unfortunately^ this intermediate lockdown has created a separate problem of its own^" Kataria said^ adding while the labour shortage was high in May it had improved in June.According to a recent report from the data analytics firm Nielsen^ the FMCG sector has touched pre-COVID-19 level sales in June^ primarily helped by a rebound in rural consumption and sales from traditional channels.Both urban and rural sales are growing but the recovery/sales from the undeveloped semi-urban/rural quarters are much faster and traditional trade channels such as neighbourhood and kirana stores have scored over modern trade outlets as retail outlets and hypermarkets^ said Nielsen.Though the country is presently going through Unlock 2.0 phase but several state governments including Bihar^ Tamil Nadu^ West Bengal and Assam have imposed localised lockdowns. Besides^ several cities such as Bengaluru and Pune are also under lockdowns after a rise in the number of virus infections.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

In the case of Britannia Industries Ltd^ things are looking up post-covid^ in stark contrast to its prospects pre-covid. A year ago^ in its Q1FY20 earnings conference call^ Varun Berry^ managing director^ Britannia^ had said there may be some serious issues with the economy if the consumer was thinking twice before buying even a ₹5 product. A year later^ while the country’s economic situation has worsened led by the unprecedented covid-19 crisis^ Britannia is having its moment in the sun. In-home packaged food consumption has increased as Indians spent more time at home during the pandemic.In its Q1FY21 earnings call on Friday^ Berry said: “We used to have 11 days of stock^ today we have 2-3 days inventory." As an analyst with a domestic institutional brokerage said: “Basically^ demand is so much that they are unable to meet it."View Full Image Good timesAhead of its June quarter results announcement^ Britannia shares touched a new 52-week high. And the numbers didn’t disappoint. Britannia’s consolidated operating revenue growth of 26.4% is already better than analysts’ gung-ho expectations. For instance^ JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd and Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd had estimated Britannia’s June quarter revenue growth at 22.6% and 22%^ respectively. The packaged foods company is expected to clock the best revenue growth for Q1FY21 among consumer firms. The rusk and bread categories grew faster than the company’s overall growth^ according to Britannia. In these business conditions^ overall volume growth of 21.5% is impressive to say the least. The balance revenue growth was helped by a combination of pricing and product mix.Earnings before interest^ taxes^ depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin expanded by 634 basis points year-on-year to 20.96%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.This was helped by a marginal decline in other expenses and a much slower pace of growth in employee costs. As such^ Ebitda increased by a whopping 81.7% over the same period last year to ₹717 crore. The good run may well continue. Britannia doesn’t think the growth rate is accelerating any further^ but it’s not seeing a significant downtrend in growth numbers either^ it said on the call. Besides^ the company said inter-corporate deposits to promoter entities have been maintained sequentially. Sure^ that’s a worry^ but with growth rates being where they are^ high valuations could well find some support.Currently^ the Britannia stock trades at a valuation multiple of around 54 times trailing 12-month earnings. Of course^ the moot question is whether Indians will continue snacking on biscuits as the covid-19 impact subsides. The answer to that question will determine Britannia’s fortunes^ going ahead.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

2020-07-13,https://www.livemint.com//companies/company-results/pepsico-reports-double-digit-volume-decline-in-india-beverage-business-11594657390855.html,LiveMint,PepsiCo reports double-digit volume decline in India beverage business,Beverage and snacking major PepsiCo on Monday reported a double-digit drop in its beverage sales in markets of India and Pakistan in the quarter ended June 13^ as the covid-19 pandemic shrunk demand and impacted sales channels^ dragging the overall volume growth in the Africa^ Middle East and SouthAsia (AMESA) region.In the AMESA region the company said its “beverage volume declined 25% reflecting double-digit declines in India and Pakistan^ a low-single-digit decline in Nigeria and a high-single-digit decline in the Middle East."The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a decrease in consumer demand^ which had a negative impact on volume performance^ the company said in its earnings statement Monday.Net revenue in the AMESA region decreased 1%^ the company said.This reflects “a net volume decline and a 6-percentage-point impact of a prior-year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in India^ partially offset by a 13-percentage- point impact of the Pioneer Foods acquisition. Net revenue was also negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic."While snacks volumes grew significantly in the region—driven by its popular brands such as Quaker Oats and Lay's that benefitted from a shift to in-home consumption—in India^ volumes declined in “double-digit" too as supplies remained disrupted in the first phase of the lockdown that started in late March here.“Snacks volume grew 117%^ primarily reflecting a 124-percentage-point impact of the Pioneer Foods acquisition^ mid-single-digit growth in the Middle East and Pakistan and low-single-digit growth in South Africa^ partially offset by a double-digit decline in India^" the company statement said.To be sure^ the period factors part of the country’s protracted lockdown that commenced late March and saw restrictions on movement of people. Manufacturing and retail operations too were disrupted in the initial days of the lockdown.For beverage makers^ peak summer months were washed out as out-of-home consumption— that includes travel^ cinemas^ restaurants—remained under strict closures.Overall^ the company that sells popular beverage brands such as Pepsi^ Tropicana^ and Gatorade said that net sales for the quarter fell 3.1% largely pulled down by its beverage business. Snacking business benefitted from a shift to in-home consumption that saw more consumers eat packaged foods. Revenue for the quarter stood at $15.95 billion.The company refrained from giving a financial outlook for 2020^ given how dynamic the situation is.“Despite being faced with significant challenges and complexities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic^ our businesses performed relatively well during the quarter^ with a notable level of resiliency in our global snacks and foods business^" PepsiCo Chairman and CEO^ Ramon Laguarta said in the statement.However^ he added that with restrictions and closures eased and population mobility improved as the quarter progressed^ the company saw an improvement in our business performance and channel mix dynamics.“However^ the environment has remained volatile and much uncertainty remains about the duration and long-term implications of the pandemic. As a result^ we are not providing a financial outlook for fiscal year 2020 at this time."Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
2020-07-13,https://www.livemint.com//news/india/household-spend-on-fmcg-went-up-4-3-in-march-may-kantar-report-11594644856520.html,LiveMint,Household spend on FMCG went up 4.3% in March-May: Kantar report,NEW DELHI: It may sound counterintuitive given the prolonged countrywide lockdown^ but household expenditure on fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) went up during March-May when compared to the same period year ago. According to a report by data^ insights and consulting company Kantar^ Indian households’ expenditure on food^ health and home care products rose 4.3% during the covid-induced lockdown.The pandemic and the fear of catching the infection prompted shoppers to make fewer trips to grocery stores^ indicating pantry-loading^ Kantar said. The number of trips to grocery stores went down from 34.3 to 30.5 during the same period. Fewer trips^ however^ translated into bigger ‘trip size’ described as volumes bought per trip resulting into value growth for companies."Households definitely spent more on FMCG products during the lockdown as compared to last year. The money was spent on food^ beverages^ health and hygiene and even home care products^" said K Ramakrishnan^ managing director at the Worldpanel division of Kantar. Personal care categories^ however^ took a hit both in urban and rural India^ the report said.Among packaged foods^ Parle Products^ the maker of Parle-G biscuits^ for instance reported a surge in sales during the lockdown. The company's market share expanded 500 bps and it registered better-than-expected growth during March to May^ Mayank Shah^ category head^ Parle Products^ had told Mint earlier.Shah said consumption was high as people bought more during the lockdown and hoarded food items.Britannia Industries^ too^ sold more packs of biscuits in April and May^ posting a 20% and 28% growth in sales^ respectively. This was on account of increased in-home consumption of its products.Marico Ltd’s Saffola cooking oil also registered strong growth during the quarter as consumers cooked more at home during the lockdown. Other FMCG firms also saw shoppers hoard large packs of staples and home-care products during the first phase of India’s lockdown^ Adani Wimar’s deputy chief executive officer^ Angshu Mallick^ had said in an interview earlier.Mallick had added that initially consumers were stockpiling so bulk packs did better. Later^ the company’s ratio of consumer packs and bulk packs changed from 65:35 to 85:15. "This is because we are seeing more people buying smaller packs and also because restaurants and hotels are closed.""While FMCG companies saw increase in home consumption of staples and other essentials^ for them the revenue from the hospitality segment or HORECA (Hotel^ Restaurants^ Cafes) remained nil^ said Ramakrishnan.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
2020-07-12,https://www.livemint.com//news/india/economy-may-shrink-by-14-2-in-q1-survey-11594575442112.html,LiveMint,Economy may shrink by 14.2% in Q1: survey,India’s economy may contract by 14.2% in the June quarter and the absence of a demand stimulus^ a second wave of coronavirus infections and continuing curbs will weigh heavily on growth prospects^ a survey of economists has found.The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) said on Sunday that its economic outlook survey conducted in June has shown an annual median growth forecast for FY21 at -4.5% and a quarterly median forecast of -14.2% for the three months ending June.Official numbers for the first quarter are expected by the end of August.Activity in sectors such as consumer durables and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are gaining traction^ but the majority of the companies are still operating at low capacity^ Ficci said.A dearth of labour and feeble demand remain major issues for the companies^ the lobby group said.Fresh investments will be difficult to come by in the near to medium term even as a significant change in consumption patterns is expected on the back of uncertainty with regard to jobs and income losses^ the lobby group said. Expenditure on non-essential goods is likely to remain under check for some time^ it said.“The absence of demand stimulus^ a second wave of the pandemic^ and continuation of social distancing and quarantine measures will weigh heavily on growth prospects. With demand and investment outlook muted^ robust government expenditure has been the only saviour^" Ficci said.The survey also indicated that some of the stimulus measures are reaching the ground^ especially through the credit guarantee scheme for small businesses and support to workers through the job guarantee scheme.“A majority of economists believed that the government could have undertaken a more aggressive fiscal stance than what has been announced in the two packages combined^" Ficci said.The government on Sunday said that the stimulus measures taken so far were reviewed and that a new scheme for bankruptcy resolution of small businesses was being prepared.Ficci said the government could consider a goods and services tax rate cut on non-essential goods to drive demand. Some tax waivers for low-income groups will also help^ it said.The industry’s appeal for demand stimulus comes in the wake of official data showing last week that industrial output had contracted for the third straight month in May^ though at a slower pace than in April. Data from the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) on 10 July showed the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) in May contracted by 34.7% against 57.6% in April. This indicated that industrial activity has begun picking up^ though getting back to previous levels remains a challenge.A host of high-frequency data^ including tractor sales for June^ forecast of a normal monsoon^ and improved summer sowing^ suggested recovery in economic activities. Many economists have also suggested that the rural economy and supply of essential goods and services remained unaffected by the lockdown and that one should not be carried away by extreme predictions of a contraction in the economy this fiscal.Travel and tourism and aviation are among the worst-affected sectors with the coronavirus pandemic taking a heavy toll on consumer confidence.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

2020-07-10,https://www.livemint.com//market/mark-to-market/why-britannia-s-shares-have-got-a-fresh-lease-of-life-post-covid-11594386631804.html,LiveMint,Why Britannia’s shares have got a fresh lease of life post covid-19,When the Street started to factor in the impact of covid-19 on consumer goods firms in February and March^ shares of Britannia Industries Ltd were among the worst hit. In the markets’ recovery phase since end-March^ that view has changed completely. Britannia is now the top-performing consumer goods stock^ rising by almost 15% from its pre-covid peak. Shares of Nestle India Ltd^ a close comparable because of its large foods portfolio^ have been flat.Within essential items^ food is at the top of the pecking order. Both companies derive their revenue from selling food products and^ increased in-home food consumption^ puts them in a sweet spot. For now^ Britannia appears to be ahead in the race among companies having a foods portfolio.Last week^ a plethora of brokerages released their June quarter preview for FMCG companies. Britannia is expected to see the strongest year-on-year revenue growth in the pack. For instance^ JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd and Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd estimate Britannia’s June quarter revenue growth at 22.6% and 22%^ respectively. These are extremely impressive growth rates^ especially at a time when most industries are grappling with a sharp decline in revenue.It is also striking that these growth rates are far better than the company’s pre-covid show. For perspective: Britannia’s consolidated revenues for FY20^ FY19 and FY18 had risen by about 4.3%^ 11.6% and 9.7%^ respectively. Krishnan Sambamoorthy^ analyst^ Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd^ said: “About 80% of Britannia’s revenue comes from biscuits where demand would be resilient in covid-19 times^ as Indians spend more time at home. Higher in-home food consumption doesn’t benefit Nestle as much in segments like infant nutrition^ chocolates and confectionary."View Full Image Cookie not crumblingThe run-up in Britannia’s shares shows that investors are cognizant of the changing operating environment. While the Britannia stock is almost 15% higher than its pre-covid highs seen in February^ shares of Hindustan Unilever Ltd and Dabur India Ltd have dropped by about 3% and 9%^ respectively^ from their February highs.While these trends are heartening^ valuations of the Britannia shares have become expensive. Based on Bloomberg data^ the stock currently trades at 48 times estimated earnings for 2021-22. And it’s not as if all is hunky dory. Even as analysts expected Britannia’s fiscal year 2021 to end relatively better than many other firms^ it remains to be seen whether these trends will sustain when the covid-19 impact starts subsiding. As mentioned earlier^ the firm’s revenue growth was subdued in the past three years.There have been concerns on capital allocation for Britannia as well. Last month^ analysts from HDFC Securities Ltd said in its March quarter results update^ “We remain cautious due to rich valuations coupled with group company investments (via inter-corporate deposits)^ rising gross debt and non-current investments."Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

It will also bolster presence in the US^ UK and Canada."We took a conscious call to broaden the focus to make it an integrated food and beverages company^" Chandrasekaran said.He said during the last financial year^ Tata Starbucks opened 39 outlets^ taking the total to 185 across the country."Owing to the pandemic^ only 50% of the outlets are open at the moment^" Chandrasekaran said.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
2020-07-01,https://www.livemint.com//companies/news/fmcgs-wait-for-out-of-home-consumption-to-pick-up-11593603835761.html,LiveMint,FMCGs wait for out-of-home consumption to pick up,NEW DELHI: Out-of-home consumption continues to be in limbo for fast moving consumer goods companies. With small shops -- kiosks and panwallahs -- still shut in several cities^ and school and colleges closed for longer periods^ impulse purchase and on-the-go categories such as chocolates^ ice-creams^ cold beverages^ small packs of chips and candies will take some time to rebound.In India^ out-of-home consumption for some categories is 30-50%.“About 30-40% of small shops still remain shut in some cities—these are typically shops that sell candies^ cigarettes^ small packs of chips and beverages. The demand for impulse categories will only come back to pre-covid levels once such shops resume business^" Subhashis Basu^ chief operating officer at Indore-based Prataap Snacks said.The company^ that sells the popular Yellow Diamond brand of chips^ recorded 80-85% of pre-covid sales in June. "A large part of this is channel filing after a gap of nearly three months that has seen an uptick in demand^" Basu added.The company's small packs of consumables^ priced at of ₹5 and ₹10^ typically clock robust sales through small shops and are linked to impulse purchases or consumed out of home. However^ in-home-consumption of its ₹20 and above price packs has also picked up.While India has been unlocking its economy^ its schools and colleges remain shut and several offices continue to work under restrictions or have employees working from home.Travel^ an important sales channel^ remains under restrictions and bars and pubs are also shut.For beverage maker Parle Agro that sells Frooti and Appy Fizz while on-the-go consumption saw a significant drop in the months of the lockdown^ the company expects the trend to continue into July.Nadia Chauhan^ joint managing director and CMO^ Parle Agro^ said despite the easing of curbs in June^ consumers have remained cautious. "Indicators imply there is a strong possibility of this trend continuing into July^ thereby seeing a continued impact on impulse categories^" she said.The company is now back to 60% of pre-covid retail coverage. "During the lockdown^ we drove an aggressive strategy with our e-commerce partners which resulted in us gaining large market share on these platforms for our categories^ especially for Frooti^" said Chauhan.For candy and confectionery maker Perfetti Van Melle also^ April-May was bad although things are getting back on track as the country 'unlocked' in June.“Due to the lockdown^ the footfalls on the streets have been adversely impacted^ and this has a direct bearing on the out-of-home consumption^ especially for impulse categories. It is difficult to put a number to this^ but during the lockdown period of end March-end to May^ many of the smaller shops and kiosks selling impulse categories were closed^" Rajesh Ramakrishnan^ managing director^ Perfetti Van Melle India--maker of Alpenliebe candy--said.The impact was more pronounced in urban markets than those in rural areas^ Ramakrishnan said.Companies have quickly moved to fulfill demand for in-home pack sizes or family packs as consumption of snacks^ chocolates and beverages moves inside homes.“One of our strategic intent has been to drive in-home stocking and in-home consumption. This is reflected in the launch of several large pack sizes across brands like Alpenliebe Juzt Jelly^ Alpenliebe^ Chupa Chups and so on^" Ramakrishnan said.Earlier this week^ chocolate and cookie company Mondelez entered the packaged cake market as it expects a surge in in-home consumption.For Mondelez too consumption of chocolates^ an impulse category and consumed while on-the-go^ has shifted in-home. The company moved to increase sales online by using its own e-commerce portal that was launched to fulfill large gift pack orders^ and allowing regular consumers to order its chocolates and cookies at home.“In-home snacking has come to take precedence as part of the ritual of spending more time with family or with oneself…homebound consumers are now increasingly looking at ways to indulge in or create at home moments."The company is leveraging all existing channels^ and has configured some of the direct to consumer routes and strategic partnerships during this period^ said a spokesperson at the company that makes Oreo cookies and Tang drinks.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

2020-06-30,https://www.livemint.com//news/india/how-patanjali-s-magic-didn-t-work-on-covid-11593527233719.html,LiveMint,How Patanjali’s magic didn’t work on covid,NEW DELHI : Most journalists in Dehradun^ the capital of Uttarakhand^ got wind of a press conference at the headquarters of Patanjali Ayurved Ltd (Patanjali) only three hours before the event. Only a few had seen a tweet about the conference by Balkrishna^ the managing director of the company that sells everything from honey to detergents^ the previous evening.But the next day^ 23 June^ witnessed a big^ chest-thumping event at Patanjali Yogpeeth in Haridwar^ one of India’s largest yoga institutes. Baba Ramdev^ the founder of Patanjali^ was flanked by eight people on a stage. Standing up^ he chanted mantras as he launched Coronil and Swasari Vati as a “cure" for coronavirus. “I am proud to announce that corona’s first Ayurvedic clinically-controlled trial based^ evidence-based^ research-based medicine is ready^" he said animatedly to applause. “Our Ayurvedic treatment is not only (for) control^ it is cure (sic). We are proud to say that there is a 100% recovery rate in seven days and 0% death."The “cure" claim opened up a Pandora’s box in little time.Herbs^ such as ashwagandha^ giloy and tulsi^ used in Patanajali’s cure are staple in other Ayurvedic concoctions too. And there is an assembly line of over 30 ongoing trials involving many Ayurvedic research institutions and companies— most of them have positioned their trials as interventions that could boost immunity or is a supplementary treatment for patients infected with covid-19.There is Dabur India Ltd^ which has sponsored studies on chyawanprash as a preventive remedy; Sri Sri Tattva^ a company founded by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar^ is studying a concoction of tulsi^ giloy^ turmeric and ashwagandha as an immunomodulator (medicines that are used to regulate the immune system); Shukla Ashar Impex Pvt. Ltd has sponsored a study to judge the effectiveness of a herbal formulation but as an add-on treatment.The government of India’s ministry of Ayush^ itself^ has sponsored some trials and one of them is studying the efficacy of ashwagandha tablets on healthy individuals to prevent covid-19.The question then remains about the uniqueness around Patanjali’s Coronil. “These products are not new. These are classic combinations that have been used for many years to boost immunity. We cannot make a claim that it will help cure because that will require a lot more research^" M. Ravi Kumar Reddy^ Sri Sri Tattva’s chief scientific officer^ told Mint.Besides exaggerated claims^ Patanjali’s conduct could have fallen short of both legal and ethical boundaries. The company picked speed over scientific rigour^ fuelling doubts on the quality of its clinical trials. In its application of clinical trial with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI)^ the company declared that its first patient was enrolled on 29 May. The estimated duration of trial mentioned two months but by 23 June^ Patanjali was ready with the medicine^ its packaging and marketing plans.At the conference^ Ramdev said the medicines would be available in seven days and an app had been readied to order home deliveries. Most of the other trials have a far longer time window—the Dabur study^ which involves multiple sites^ declared that the estimated duration of trail is eight months.“Purely from a process point of view^ it (the Patanjali claim) makes a mockery of drug regulation in India. I don’t understand what is the point of having the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act^ which provides for criminal prosecution^" Dinesh S. Thakur^ a public health activist and an expert in drug regulation^ said.“In this case^ there is a clear violation of the law because the company went on television and said they have a 100% cure for covid-19. Ramdev didn’t say he had promising early stage results^" he added.Perhaps Ramdev wanted to be first off the block in a race that would have meant significant windfall for Patanjali—the earliest results from other Ayurveda trials are not expected before mid-July. Patanjali is struggling with market share losses in many FMCG product categories and a magic covid drug was just the panacea the company’s business needed.“People are worried. Making a claim like this is likely to feed into the general fear of the people about covid-19. It could lead to a lot of uptake in the hope that this medicine will be protective^" Prof. K. Srinath Reddy^ president^ Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI)^ said.Ethics on trialThe campus of NIMS University in Jaipur is surrounded by the Aravalli hills. Different corporate videos tell us that the picturesque campus also has state-of-art infrastructure^ a modern laboratory^ well-stocked library and offers over 500 courses. The university^ nevertheless^ has often courted controversy. In 2016^ chairman Balvir S. Tomar was arrested by the Jharkhand police on attempt to rape charges. And in 2017^ the Supreme Court ordered demolition of illegal construction on land the university encroached—the encroachments^ the court noted^ had impacted Ramgarh Lake^ a reservoir of water supply to Jaipur city.Patanjali chose to partner the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (NIMS)^ which is part of the university^ for its clinical trial. NIMS is an allopathic institute and the principal and co-investigators are both allopathic doctors without expertise in Ayurveda medicine. “Sponsors are usually involved in study oversight^ usually through study monitors who are experts or specialised organizations contracted for this purpose. But here^ since it’s a Ayurvedic study being conducted by an allopathic institution^ one or more of the investigators themselves should have been Ayurveda experts^" Anant Bhan^ a researcher and past president of the International Association of Bioethics^ said.NIMS said they had Ayurvedic expertise to draw on but is fuzzy about details. “We are being assisted by S. Bhandari^ who is an Ayurvedic doctor running a Patanjali clinic in Jaipur^ as well as another Dr Anurag^" Ganpat Devpura^ professor of medicine at NIMS and the principal investigator for the Patanjali-sponsored trial^ said. However^ Devpura did not share any further detail on Bhandari and didn’t provide Dr Anurag’s surname.Guidelines for clinical trials by Indian Council of Medical Research and ministry of Ayush make it mandatory for an ethics committee to probe possible conflicts of interest when academic institutions conduct research along with companies. It was not clear whether the review was conducted or what were the findings.Bhan pointed to bigger ethical slips— Patanjali never shared the protocol of the trial nor did it share its findings through a peer-reviewed journal article. “Sharing by a press conference is very surprising because then there is no way of verifying the claims. Somebody should be looking at the data before any marketing of the product is allowed^" Bhan said. He added that no company makes a claim about 100% efficacy and cure—even the best drugs don’t have that sort of a success. “It does reflect a poor understanding of scientific methods^" Bhan concluded.Emailed queries to Patanjali and Baba Ramdev’s media teams were not answered. CEO Balkrishna didn’t take calls. Clarifications sought from NIMS remained unanswered as well. On Tuesday^ Patanjali told the Uttarakhand Ayurved department that it had not made any medicine called “corona kit" and never said that it can “cure" coronavirus. Mint spoke to Y.S. Rawat^ licensing officer at the department^ who said: “Our inspector had also visited the Patanjali factory yesterday (Monday)^ and we did not find any ‘Corona Kit’ packaging there".Meanwhile^ the central government has thus far donned kid-gloves on the issue— that’s not surprising given that Ramdev campaigned for the BJP in the 2014 elections. When Mint approached the secretary of the ministry of Ayush^ Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha^ he refused to comment on whether the ministry will be taking any action against Patanjali for making claims of a miracle cure. “All action we have taken is in the public domain. If we take any further action^ it will come out in the public domain^" Kotecha said on the phone.The ministry had asked Patanjali to furnish more details around the composition of the medicines^ the clinical study^ and the protocol followed^ among others. The company was directed to stop advertising the claims till they were verified.The baba’s imperativeBaba Ramdev is an aggressive entrepreneur—he wants to be bigger than Hindustan Unilever Ltd^ one of India’s largest FMCG companies^ with revenues of over ₹38^000 crore in 2019/20.Patanjali’s consolidated revenues from operations stood at ₹8^523 crore in 2018-19^ according to disclosures made to the ministry of corporate affairs. In 2019^ the company acquired Ruchi Soya which has yearly revenues of over ₹13^000 crore. In an interview to BloombergQuint in January 2020^ Ramdev said that Patanjali and Ruchi Soya^ combined^ can clock revenues of ₹20^000-25^000 crore in 2019/20.The problem is that Patanjali^ after many promising years^ appears to have lost ground in many FMCG segments. Not just Unilever^ ITC and Dabur are doing better too^ going by market data. Traditional FMCG companies have both protected their markets and clawed back any market share lost. Patanjali’s revenue and profit growth trajectory reflects this changing market dynamics.Between 2015 and 2017^ the company’s revenues more than quadrupled to over ₹9^000 crore. A sharp decline of 11% in 2017-18 was next followed by a recovery of 5% the next year. Net profit margins^ meanwhile^ slipped from 15-16% in 2015-16 to 4% in 2018-19 as the company struggled with higher expenses.Kantar^ a consulting company^ tracks household consumption. In 2019-20^ Patanjali de-grew nearly 15% in both urban and rural households in terms of volumes over the previous year. In the same period^ ITC grew 18% and HUL 8%. The average monthly consumption of Patanjali products stood at 2kg during the year. In comparison^ the average consumption of HUL’s products were six times higher and three times bigger for ITC. Even in rural markets^ Patanjali has significantly dropped in volumes.“Patanjali grew only in toothpastes and biscuits but is seeing significant declines in other key categories^" K. Ramakrishnan^ managing director—South Asia^ Worldpanel Division^ Kantar^ said.“Patanjali did well in honey and chyawanprash three years back^ but they may have lost market share^" added Abneesh Roy^ executive vice-president at Edelweiss Financial Services. “In FMCG^ R&D and quality is very important. Patanjali has struggled here^ which is why they are suffering. The company had big plans but they are nowhere near to achieving their target^" he said.There are other reasons why Patanjali lost its way. Ankur Bisen^ senior vice-president^ retail and consumer products at Technopak^ pointed out that the company no longer has strong relationships with retailers. Patanjali overestimated their brand value and their ability to dictate terms to the market. The analyst estimated that in 2016^ there were about 4^700 exclusive stores selling Patanjali products. This has shrunk to about 1^900 now.All this has piled up pressure on Patanjali to break new ground with its products^ show innovation and demonstrate speed. This perhaps explains why the company jumped the gun with its covid cure. And^ the way it was handled has become a negative for the ayurveda medicines business^ analysts said.The path aheadThe controversy has brought to the fore yet again the tensions between evidence-based medicine and other forms of treatment^ be it Ayurveda^ Naturopathy^ Unani^ Siddha or Homoeopathy. Many believe that not all Ayurvedic mixes are safe—the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cautions: “Lead^ mercury^ and arsenic have been found in some Ayurvedic products. Certain populations^ including children^ are particularly at risk for the toxic effects of heavy metals".Public health experts^ therefore^ are asking that India’s ministry of Ayush create a regulatory pathway to evaluate and approve traditional Indian therapeutics because clinical trials aren’t designed to understand or prove conclusively how traditional drugs work.“What we need is a system to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ayurvedic drugs. Just like clinical trials are used to develop evidence of benefit-risk for chemicals and biological medicines^ there ought to be a method^ a process to evaluate how Ayurvedic drugs actually work^" Dinesh Thakur said.The Patanjali fiasco could just be that trigger to set things in order.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
2020-06-22,https://www.livemint.com//market/mark-to-market/the-curious-case-of-resilience-of-avenue-supermarts-stock-in-covid-times-11592808484148.html,LiveMint,The curious case of the resilience of Avenue Supermarts’ stock,Shares of Avenue Supermarts Ltd are now just 8% lower from their 52-week highs in mid-February. Avenue runs the DMart chain of retail stores. Last month^ investors had received a reality check after its subdued commentary on April sales during the March quarter results announcement. But^ since then^ the stock staged a smart revival.This is indeed striking^ given the pressure on consumption demand due to the pandemic. Plus^ it is not as if Avenue derives all its revenue from the sale of essential products^ where demand has been relatively resilient. In FY20^ food and non-food (fast-moving consumer goods or FMCG) categories contributed 52.4% and 20.3% to revenues^ respectively. General merchandise and apparel^ where sales has been hit the most during lockdown^ accounted for 27.3% of revenue. Note that shares of FMCG firms^ Nestle India Ltd and Britannia Industries Ltd^ fell 12% and 7.7% from their respective 52-week highs. This is even though they earn all their revenues from the sale of food products.“Even among the defensive set of stocks^ the Avenue stock has surprised me^" said an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage^ requesting anonymity. But^ some are convinced about Avenue’s business prospects. Rajiv Sharma^ head of research^ SBICAP Securities Ltd^ said: “In Avenue’s case^ it’s not so much as what they are selling in terms of essential or not^ but more about at what price points they are bringing value for the price conscious Indian consumer. Here^ Avenue has a moat."To be sure^ despite virus-led disruptions^ Avenue clocked healthy 23% revenue growth for the March quarter. Naturally^ this growth would be tough to replicate in this quarter given the lockdown. Avenue has said that revenues in April fell over 45% year-on-year. There was some improvement in May.Even so^ there are challenges. Some expect Avenue’s mix to deteriorate with the general merchandise and apparel segment being impacted more. This is a higher-margin segment and^ as such^ would affect overall margins.Sharma of SBICAP said: “The competitive landscape is changing with competition (Reliance Retail and several startups including Amazon and Flipkart) attempting to aggregate kiranas and digitizing at the hyperlocal level. Such changes suggest that Avenue should equally be aggressive about its D-Mart Ready initiative as it is about the offline store addition."In the interim^ though^ if earnings growth drops more than expected in FY21^ then valuations may well get a reality check. After all^ Avenue’s high growth versus other consumer firms is one reason for its appeal.Its shares trade at a whopping 115 times FY20 earnings. Its efficiency metrics are far ahead of peers. “If DMart cannot clock ₹36000-37000 per square feet of revenue (roughly what it managed in FY19 & FY20)^ as people choose to avoid crowded places^ then the very heart of its efficiencies could get challenged^ in our view^" said analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd^ in a report on 25 May.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

Ltd is eyeing consolidation opportunities in the bread and bakery industry as the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted smaller regional brands with weak balance sheets.Everstone had acquired Modern Foods from fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) major Hindustan Unilever Ltd in 2016. The company makes breads^ cookies^ cakes^ buns^ muffins and Indian breads under the Modern brand."It (covid-19) has given us an opportunity to evaluate interesting options that are coming up across the bread and bakery space as well as allied businesses. We think this is the right time and we are looking at inorganic growth quite actively^" said Roshini Bakshi^ managing director at Everstone Group.Modern Food has appointed South African bank Investec to advise it on setting up a strategic review and a growth roadmap."Investec has been put in place to help us as we put together our strategic path forward^ especially with reference to acquisitions and the potential valuations^" said Bakshi.Inorganic growth is a strategy that Modern Food has adopted in the past as well. Last year^ it acquired Delhi-based baker Supreme Baker to establish its presence in the Delhi NCR market^ while earlier it had acquired Cookie Man."We are getting inbounds from the west of India as well as the North^ both of which are large bread and bakery markets. So we continue to look at opportunities as they come to us^" said Bakshi.The covid-19 pandemic has given a strong boost to the company^ which sells over half a million bread loaves daily across the country."We did over 30% higher business this year^ compared to April and May of 2019^" said Aseem Soni^ chief executive officer at Modern Food."In this new environment consumers started trusting brands that have a long legacy. The smaller players in the bread industry had to shut shop because they had a huge issue in terms of costs going up^ with stricter hygiene standards and other constraints^" he added.Covid-19 has also boosted sales of the bread maker's health and wellness portfolio as the pandemic led to consumers becoming more health conscious."The health and wellness portfolio of every company^ including breads^ was more in demand than the basic white bread. We have two interesting products in our portfolio – 100% Whole Wheat Bread AND Hi-Fibre Brown and both these products took off in the lockdown period^" said Soni.In the post covid-19 world^ this trend of increased focus on health and wellness is expected to accentuate^ he added.Currently^ health and wellness products make up for just 20% of the company's business but they are a faster growing segment compared to white breads.The company is now focusing on expanding its health and wellness portfolio and is working on a bread product to help boost immunity."The AYUSH ministry has clearly recommended ingredients that help build immunity^ things like turmeric^ black pepper^ ginger^ cinnamon^ jaggery^ which are traditional Indian products that help build immunity. Currently^ we are working in the lab to see if we can accommodate a smart and palatable combination of these ingredients into bread and come up with a bread that helps build immunity in the medium to long term^" said Soni.While sales are on the upswing^ restrictions imposed during lockdown and disruptions in supply chain and labour market have meant that costs have shot up."Broadly it (lockdown) would have added 5 to 7 percentage points (to the costs) from a gross margin percentage perspective^ which is significant^" said Soni but added that the company doesn't intend to pass on the costs to customers at this point of time."We think that some of these costs are temporary^ such as higher raw material cost^ higher packaging costs. Some of the costs such as the hygiene costs are more long term but that cost should get compensated by growing business."Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

Suresh Narayanan^ chairman and managing director (MD) at Nestle India Ltd; Angshu Mallick^ deputy chief executive officer (CEO) at Adani Wilmar; Arvind Mediratta^ MD and CEO of Metro Cash & Carry India; and Saugata Gupta^ MD and CEO at Marico Ltd^ spoke about how they are responding to the emerging challenges.Demand RevivalThanks to a bumper crop this year^ rural demand is likely to remain strong^ which^ in turn^ will aid revival in demand. Also^ demand will see an uptick with increased government spending on social security schemes such as MGNREGA^ which will benefit a large number of migrants returning to their home states and taking up jobs under government schemes.Cultural DimensionIf firms spend more on improving their work culture^ then there will be better-run companies. As they navigate the crisis^ firms need to look at six ‘R’s to become successful: Relevance^ Resonance^ Renewal^ Recalibration^ Reconstruction and Resurgence.Digital ShiftMost firms are fast adapting to digital transformation^ where traditional distribution channels are becoming part of an extended back-end^ being replaced by digital front-ends. These transformations are being led by big e-commerce companies as well as small stores to stay relevant.Right Product MixDuring the lockdown^ customers^ especially in rural areas^ moved from larger packs to smaller packs to conserve cash. FMCG firms that are quick to spot the changing behaviour and can adapt accordingly will emerge as likely winners in the post-covid world.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
2020-06-05,https://www.livemint.com//industry/retail/-consumers-will-embrace-ready-to-cook-frozen-meals-11591297821945.html,LiveMint,‘Consumers will embrace ready-to-cook^ frozen meals’,NEW DELHI : With most people working from homes with limited dine-outs due to fears of viral infection^ consumers may buy ready-to-eat and convenience food products^ said top officials from fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) firms at the Mint’s Pivot or Perish FMCG in India: Bridging the Digital Gap campaign on Thursday.Adani Wilmar Ltd^ which sells the Fortune brand of edible oils^ said it has received encouraging response to its ready-to-cook (RTC) range of khichdis in three variants. “During the lockdown^ people wanted something which is easy to cook since various food items were not easily available. We distributed it faster and the response was good. We are extending this range by planning more products for this portfolio^" said Angshu Mallick^ deputy CEO^ Adani Wilmar.Noting that food and grocery will continue to do well^ Arvind Mediratta^ MD and CEO^ METRO Cash and Carry India said the future demand of consumers will largely be impacted by products that will bring them convenience.“Frozen foods category is not being talked about^ but will see adoption and growth. With people working from home and unavailability of house helps^ people are looking for ready to eat meals and frozen food^" he added.Mediratta also emphasised that due to the pandemic^ eating out is not an option^ which will further drive people to try and replicate dishes they usually order at restaurants.“People are also looking for variety with frozen food such as kebabs^ french fries and potato wedges being the kind of products that can easily be made. The frozen food category has witnessed 70-80% jump in sales and it is still growing strong^" he said. Mediratta said large-scale job losses in urban markets will create strain on household financials^ leading consumers to buy only basics and essentials for some more time. Therefore^ the demand for discretionary products has slowed down and it will eventually come down as well.saumya.t@livemint.comSubscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

The extent of the contraction in sales^ however^ depended on the products that these firms sold.The top fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies had achieved 50-100% of sales that they did last year during the first quarter^ depending on their product portfolio^ said Pinakiranjan Mishra^ sector leader^ consumer products and retail^ EY. “Companies with a portfolio of health and sanitization products^ food and other essentials would definitely perform better." Sales in April were down by as much 65%^ while those in May were down by 40% compared to the year-ago period^ said an executive of a packaged-foods company. June sales will likely be more encouraging at 80-90% compared to the year-ago period^ as the country moved into a more liberal opening up of the economy^ said the executive^ who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The latest update on the company's business being disrupted has not dented the stock price much. HUL stock was marginally down at 0.4% early Wednesday.HUL said the impact on discretionary categories like hair care^ skincare and colour cosmetics is more accentuated. While there is some demand revival in these categories^ it could take a while for sales to fully recover in these segments.Other categories such as ice cream and foods solutions and consumer durables business of water have been worst hit by the lockdown. HUL also noted that loss of livelihoods has taken a substantial toll on consumer demand.Demand in categories like hygiene^ though^ has picked up post the outbreak of the pandemic. HUL said there is heightened consumer focus on health^ hygiene and nutritional needs amid the pandemic. Hence^ some of its categories such as skin cleansing^ home & hygiene^ nutrition^ tea^ coffee and foods are better positioned to cater to these consumer demand spaces.Another positive is that the company has been able to ramp up its operations in the past few months. “Immediately following the nationwide lockdown on account of the COVID-19 crisis^ operations came to a near standstill; HUVR was able to operate at 5% of pre-COVID normative levels. The company was able to gradually improve operations to 70% in April and has now successfully ramped up its production to 80–90% of normative levels^" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a note to clients.HUL also said it does not foresee any incremental risk concerning its ability to service financial arrangements. The company has a good cushion to deploy credit to support its supply chains.Of course^ some of the disruption due to covid-19 has been factored in by analysts. The profitability of the company is likely to be impacted in Q1FY21 with analysts factoring about 10-12% volume decline. However^ normalised volume growth is expected from Q2 onwards.Additionally^ HUL’s merger of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare’s business with itself is expected to bring synergy benefits. But the stock still may not provide much comfort as it trades at a stiff valuation of 73.32 times its FY20 earnings.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

Almost all our suppliers in India^ who were not operating at all in the initial period of the lockdown^ are now operational. All our office-based employees have continued to work-from-home with effect from 17th March^ 2020^" the maker of Kissan jams and Dove soaps said in a filing to the exchanges on Tuesday.Workmen at the company’s Nabha plant^ that it acquired as part of GSK Consumer Healthcare India Limited's merger with HUL^ are currently on a strike^ it said.“We are working with all stakeholders to find a resolution and will take appropriate steps as required^" HUL said in its update.The lockdown towards the end of March prompted several FMCG companies to temporarily halt production as well as shut their warehouses and distribution centres.As the country has moved to ease the lockdown^ movement of people and vehicles has helped HUL reach more outlets and households.However^ HUL said it cannot with predict with certainty when demand in the certain categories will rebound^ especially as companies deal with restoring their supplies in the market and service consumers who are struggling with financial uncertainty brought about by the lockdown.This is likely to have a bearing on demand among Indian households.“Lockdown has severely impacted the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) market and the loss of livelihoods has taken a substantial toll on consumer demand^" it said.As a result^ impact on discretionary categories like skin and hair care^ and especially color cosmetics could could be more pronounced.“With mobility restrictions^ lockdown of retail spaces and fear of loss of income^ the impact on discretionary categories like hair care^ skin care and colour cosmetics is more accentuated. While we are seeing some demand revival in these categories^ the exact time which these categories will take to recover fully remains to be seen^" it added in its update.Moreover^ its out of home businesses comprising of ice creams and foods solutions and its consumer durables business of water “have been most severely impacted by the lockdown".The lockdown announced in March had significantly shrunk HUL’s ability to manufacture goods as operations were down to just 5% of pre-covid normative levels.However^ things have subsequently improved in the months of April and May.“The company has been working very closely with the government at different levels to ensure policy and permit compliances and reboot the supply line. We were able to gradually improve the operations to ~70% in the month of April and have now been able to ramp-up our production to 80-90% of normative levels^" HUL said in its update.The pandemic has also ushered several changes in consumer behavior—that HUL said it is responding to.“We are staying close to our consumers with frequent digital interactions and through social listening.

Industry representatives^ who spoke to Mint^ said apart from lack of demand and labour shortage^ the varying rules of operations in different states remain a key factor and could lengthen the road to recovery.On Saturday^ the central government announced a phased lifting of the lockdown^ in place since 25 March to contain the spread of covid-19^ to be implemented from 8 June.Under phase 1^ hotels^ restaurants^ and other hospitality services along with shopping malls and places of religious work will be allowed to reopen.Mint had reported on 30 May^ citing senior government officials^ that Maharashtra^ which has the highest number of covid 19 cases^ will allow only essential and non-essential goods and service providers to begin operations for now^ while shopping complexes and malls will have to wait longer."We welcome the lifting of lockdown as opening up of malls and other categories of retail said Kumar Rajagopalan^ chief executive^ Retailers Association of India (RAI)."The biggest problem for us is the different rules for operation that are expected in not just between states but also at a local district^ taluka or ward level... some places have odd-even rules for opening stores^ others have restricted timings. Some local bodies say not more than five customers are allowed at one point in time^ others say you cannot switch on air conditioning^ even though it’s the middle of summer. We’ve been working with local governments to address these problems. They need to realise that if retail doesn’t work^ industries get affected^" Rajagopalan said.The manufacturing industry^ also among the worst hit by the lockdown^ will also be a big beneficiary of the lifting of the lockdown but full resumption of operations may take time.For the auto industry^ this easing of restrictions will help dealerships to resume operations in some areas while also aiding suppliers. Production^ though^ will depend on the demand in the market^" said Vikram Kirloskar^ vice chairman^ Toyota Kirloskar Motors and chairman^ CII."Demand is slowly picking up now as construction activity resumes^" Deependra Kashiva^ executive director^ Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association^ told Mint. “But it will take at least another six months to return to pre-lockdown operating levels of 70-75% capacity. When the monsoon sets in^ construction will slow down again and demand will be affected a second time.""We’re happy to see that 60-80% of our units in Chhattisgarh^ West Bengal and Odisha have started operations again. Units in Maharashtra and Gujarat^ which employed a lot of migrant labour from the central and eastern states^ will find it more difficult since many workers have returned to their villages. Our main problem is that there is no clear visibility of demand."Sandeep Sahni^ chief executive^ Patel Infrastructure^ a road construction company^ concurred. “We’re studying the modalities for operations in different states^" he told Mint. The company has operational sites at Tamil Nadu^ Gujarat^ Rajasthan and Punjab. “We’re seeing if we can move workers between our different sites because there is a shortage of labour. Once the trains start and workers come back^ this problem might ease. We’re still operating at just 25-30% of our capacity. I think it will take another 2-3 months for us to return to pre-lockdown levels.""The manufacturing front concerns still remain. The relaxation in terms of allowing labour at your plants has still not come. There is still a bar employing more than 50% labour in your manufacturing plant. So that will impact production. We are hoping relaxation comes in^ even in a staggered manner^ for employing labour^" said Mayank Shah^ Category Head at Parle Products Pvt. LtdThough consumer demand had started slowing down even before the coronavirus outbreak^ the ensuing lockdown brought along challenges on the manufacturing and supply side. FMCG manufacturing has been hit hard by lockdown which has resulted in labor shortages^ forcing companies to scale down operations. Lockdown impact has also been felt on traditional distribution and channel systems due to lack of stocks.Going forward^ businesses fear a drop in consumption^ especially discretionary spend^ as rising unemployment in the country will hit disposable income and in turn demand.( Malyaban Ghosh and Kalpana Pathak contributed to the story.)Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

The company had posted a net profit of ₹370 crore in the year-ago period.For the quarter ended 31 March^ consolidated revenue from operations stood at ₹1^865.36 crore^ down 12.3% from the ₹2^128.19 reported by the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company in the year-ago period.“Dabur opened the fourth quarter on a positive note^ successfully tapping the growth opportunities. However^ the COVID outbreak in March^ followed by the nationwide lockdown^ caused severe disruptions in our business and brought sales to a virtual standstill in the second fortnight of March 2020^" Dabur India's chief executive officer^ Mohit Malhotra^ said in a statement.The company’s seasonal portfolio of products^ said Malhotra^ were hit as the company lost sales due the the nationwide lockdown in late March. “With most of products across our healthcare^ home and personal care and foods portfolio falling in the non-essential category^ the pre-season sales of summer skewed products to meet the seasonal demand was severely impacted^" he said.Interestingly^ Indian shoppers stocked up on the company’s immunity boosting Chyawanprash apart from buying more of its honey. “We are already witnessing a 400% surge in demand for our flagship immunity booster Dabur Chyawanprash and an 80% growth in Dabur Honey^" Malhotra said.The company has invested in expanding capacity for the two brands after it witnessed a stock-out situation in the market.Revenue at the company’s food business that comprises Real juices and Hommade cooking products declined 21% for the quarter ended March^ while its consumer business reported revenues of ₹1^590 crore^ down from ₹1^788.56 crore reported in the year-ago period.Dabur sells oral care brands^ apart from skin care^ hair oils^ shampoos^ home care^ health supplements^ among other household products.It was among the first few FMCG companies to suspend operations at its manufacturing units before the nationwide lockdown. On 23 March^ Dabur halted operations at roughly 60-70% of its manufacturing plants in India. Dabur has 12 manufacturing units in the country.Going forward^ Malhotra said the company will take cues from consumer shift towards immunity building^ health^ and hygiene products.Demand patterns have changed significantly^ with consumers increasingly seeking Ayurveda-based interventions for boosting immunity^ besides products that meet their personal and household hygiene needs^ he said. As a result^ Dabur has developed a strong pipeline of innovations to address the growing consumer need for preventive healthcare and personal hygiene.“We have already rolled out a slew of innovations in the Preventive Healthcare space with the launch of immunity boosters like Dabur Tulsi Drops^ Dabur Amla Juice^ Dabur Giloy-Neem-Tulsi juice and Dabur Immunity Kit^ to name a few. In addition^ the company has also ventured into the personal & household hygiene space with the launch of hand sanitisers^ air sanitisers and disinfectants under the Dabur Santize brand^" he said.Dabur has been scaling its reach into India’s villages as it hopes to cover more ground in the country’s rural markets that account for over 35% of spends for FMCG industry.“We have already invested ahead of the curve in building a strong rural footprint^ which today covers over 52^000 villages. We are investing in enhancing this coverage to around 60^000 villages by the end of this year^ which would further strengthen our foundation and help us deliver sustainable profitable growth in the coming quarters^" he said.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

2020-05-22,https://www.livemint.com//industry/retail/meat-consumption-dips-kiranas-drag-fmcg-growth-in-april-nielsen-11590156790728.html,LiveMint,Non-vegetarian food consumption dips^^ kiranas drag FMCG growth in April: Nielsen,NEW DELHI : Consumers in India showed aversion to buying non-vegetarian food during the country's lockdown^ especially across modern trade formats^ market researcher Nielsen said in its report on Friday as it monitored shifts in consumer behavior brought about by covid-19.The dip in demand for non-vegetarian food was led by channel and supply chain constraints and a lower purchase intent among shoppers^ Nielsen said as it surveyed consumer demand for staples^ packaged foods^ and home care products across various trade formats such as supermarkets and kiranas. In modern trade stores^ especially^ Nielsen said demand for seafood dipped by over 60% due to supply chain issues^ low shelf life and reduced footfall in phase 1 and phase 2 of the lockdown.However^ in the days prior to the lockdown^ modern trade stores witnessed pantry loading of staples and convenience food items. Gradually^ said Nielsen^ as India moved in to the lockdown phase later March^ shopper focus reduced on staples; while convenience categories^ however^ continued to grow.India's fast moving consumer goods saw sales dip by as much as 34% in the month of April compared to a year ago period^ estimates by Nielsen suggest as the lockdown caused a disruption in supplies.The slowdown was led by a sharp dip in sales across small neighborhood grocery stores or traditional trade formats that were forced to shut down in parts of the country or work amid restricted hours that Nielsen said caused a sharp deceleration in growth of the sector. Modern trade stores^ however^ continued to grow in the month of March and April benefitting from early pantry-loading in March.Last month^ Nielsen slashed its 2020 growth outlook for India’s fast moving consumer goods sector to 5-6% from its earlier projection of 9-10% due to the covid-19 crisis.“After a three per cent decline in Mar ‘20 (versus Mar ‘19)^ FMCG industry clocked a 34% decline in April—traditional trade channels led this sharp drop^ while modern trade continued to grow in April 2020^" Nielsen researchers said in their third update on impact of covid-19 on the fast moving consumer goods sector on Friday.Nielsen said that in April^ traditional trade channels—that account for 88% of FMCG sales in India—witnessed a sharp de-growth due to area or shop closures.“On an average^ a traditional retail shop was closed for 12 days in April due to various restrictions and constraint—this number was significantly higher for outlets other than Chemists (4 days) and Grocers (8 days)." Nielsen said^ this led to a loss in business. Retailers also found it hard to procure a full range of goods amid restricted movement and production of supplies.In fact^ consumers pivoted to organized retail formats such as online commerce^ and modern trade stores—this was especially true in the days prior to the lockdown as consumers rushed to large format grocery stores to load their monthly groceries.Nielsen noted that in the days prior to the lockdown^ average weekly value sales at modern trade stores jumped from ₹690 crore to ₹910 core indicating pantry-loading by shoppers. This subsequently cooled down across modern trade^ e-commerce^ and cash and carry formats that also saw sales dip due to operational restrictions and reduced staff.“The FMCG Industry increased sales in the weeks prior to the lockdown announcement across organised retail and organised wholesale channels^ this can be attributed to stockpiling. As we entered the lockdown phase^ we saw a steep decline in sales across channels. This was caused by mobility restrictions and supply side challenges^" Nielsen’s research said.India’s strict lockdown that began towards the end of March^ also prompted several packaged consumer goods companies to temporarily suspend their operations; moreover^ movement of goods from warehouses to retailers remained stuck as the lockdown placed curbs on movement of people.This also prompted companies to pull back on consumer offers that led to a increase in average prices of key foods and beverage brands such as soft drinks^ packaged ghee^ flour^ tea^ cooking oils at modern trade stores in the months of March and April. “This was caused by retailer-led promotions slowing down^ and change in brand and pack mixes^" Nielsen said.However^ now that the lockdown has eased^ Nielsen expects kirana stores to make a come by as restrictions over opening hours ease out."As things become better—shops get permission to open for regular hours and supply chains ease^ and with all learnings and technology coming in^ it will make traditional trade a more more viable business model and a better experience^" Sameer Shukla^ west market leader^ South Asia^ Nielsen Global Connect said.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

The company^ which sells packaged flour^ among other things^ added consumer packs or those up to 5kg are seeing rising demand.“Our ratio of consumer packs and bulk packs has changed from 65:35 earlier to 85:15 now. This is because we are seeing more people buying smaller packs and also because restaurants and hotels are closed^" said Angshu Mallick^ deputy CEO^ Adani Wilmar.Sunil Kataria^ CEO^ India and Saarc^ Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL)^ agreed. “In rural areas^ we are likely to see an increase in demand because of the reverse migration of workers and their families. Affordable^ low-value packs will be a big draw for consumers in rural areas^" Kataria said. GCPL sells hair colour^ soaps and mosquito repellents^ among other things.There will be opportunity for popularly priced products as a result of some down-trading that will happen in semi-urban and rural markets^ Suresh Narayanan^ chairman and managing director^ Nestlé India^ said in a video call. “You will start seeing the smaller packs starting to do better^" he said.Marico Ltd’s Saffola cooking oil registered strong growth during the quarter as consumers cooked more at home during the lockdown^ but its discretionary portfolio of personal care products^ such as male grooming^ serums and hair care^ was hit^ it said in a post-earnings call last month to state its fourth-quarter results. As a result^ the company is “mulling over a low-value small package strategy to allow consumers to access some of these offerings in personal care in a slow economic environment"^ said Saugata Gupta^ the company’s managing director.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

The announcement come as part of the central government’s guidelines for the fourth phase of the lockdown that will extend till 31 May. To be sure^ containment zones will continue to remain out of bounds to all non-essential movement.Retailers and trade associations said they will wait for the required directives from state governments before they proceed to open shops and markets. “Union Home Ministry guidelines for Lockdown 4 allowed shops to open but state governments will have to take decision as to what will open and in what manner. Traders have now to wait for guidelines to be issued by respective states^" Praveen Khandelwal^ secretary general^ Confederation of All India Traders^ said.He added that the state governments will need to ensure synergies between traders^ manufacturers and logistics companies before markets open—to ensure movement of people and goods.“The state government is also under obligation to release a list of do’s and dont’s for security measures to be adopted by traders^" he said^ stressing the need for clarity on the orders going forward.In its order^ the Union home ministry specified that hotels^ malls^ cinema halls and bars will^ however^ continue to remain shut nationwide. “All other activities will be permitted^ except those that are specifically prohibited^" the MHA said.“We need to wait for state government orders^" Kumar Rajagopalan^ chief executive^ Retailers Association of India (RAI) said. Earlier only “standalone" and “neighbourhood" shops were allowed to operate ^while those in markets and market complexes remained shut. As a result^ retailers were losing out in business^ especially as large markets are key to India’s retail trade.However^ concerns around safety and the spread of infection are also making trade associations cautious^ some of whom said they will keep their markets closed.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

On Sunday^ finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an injection of ₹40^000 crore to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) to enable people in rural India^ including millions returning home from urban areas to their villages^ find jobs.With a Budget allocation of ₹61^000 crore announced in the Budget^ the allocation to the scheme now stands at ₹1.01 crore^ the highest ever for the programme.Dabur India Ltd chief executive officer Mohit Malhotra said the finance minister’s final tranche of the economic package would lead to creation of more jobs in the hinterland and ease the distress of migrant workers returning home."The government’s decision to allocate additional ₹40^000 crore for the MGNREGS scheme would certainly put more money in the hands of rural consumers and spur consumption in rural markets. Allowing private investments in all sectors is another positive move that would lead to job creation^" he said.Angshu Mallick^ deputy CEO at Adani Wilmar Ltd^ the maker of the Fortune brand of edible oil and other packaged food^ said that the additional allocation will surely put more cash in the hands of migrant labourers and small farmers. “This money will bring more liquidity and lead to demand in groceries and FMCG products except dal^ wheat and rice because the government has agreed to give free rations for three months and further two months so there is enough availability of rice^ wheat and pulses^" he said.Abneesh Roy^ executive vice president (research) at Edelweiss Securities^ also sees the move as a “positive" for consumer staples companies. “This would stimulate demand^" he said.Anil Talreja^ partner and leader consumer business^ said the allocation to MNREGA is one of the ways whereby the government intends to go to the root of the rural market and provide the fuel for development and growth."This is the heart of India as it is very closely associated with agriculture^ which comprises a significant portion of our economy. The benefits announced under this scheme will certainly charge up the rural sections of the society and benefit to the much needy and poor^" Talreja said.Rural markets that contribute 36% to overall FMCG spending have been slowing down for the past couple of years. For the first time in the last seven years^ rural growth dropped below urban^ according to Nielsen’s July-September 2019 update. And just when things looked to be improving earlier this year^ the covid-19 outbreak has set the markets back again with Nielsen refraining giving any projections for rural demand for the year.To be sure^ many experts argue that the government has announced several long-term reforms with little attention to immediate demand revival.“Companies would have preferred if direct cash transfer would have happened because many of them (rural and migrant workers) have not been paid by employers for the last 2-3 months; they need cash in hand. The need of the hour was direct transfer into their accounts. They have no money. If you give them money let them decide what they need. Not sure if this will lead to demand in rural areas^" said Arvind Mediratta^ managing director and chief executive officer at the local arm of German retailer Metro Cash & Carry^ which runs 27 wholesale stores in the country.Added Adani’s Mallick^ “One big negative for the industry is that these migrant labourers are not going to return to their original work place fast^ leading to shortage of skilled and unskilled labourers."Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

Like everyone else^ Parle is not running any major promotions for most of its packaged foods^ he added.Companies often cut prices^ offer extra grammage and make some products free with other purchases from the same brand to lure value-hunters and fight competition. However^ these offers work best at times of low demand^ said executives from the FMCG industry. At a time when the coronavirus lockdown has choked output^ companies find little merit in continuing with such promotions^ focusing instead on meeting existing demand.“Right now^ the focus is primarily on ensuring the production and supply chain and getting the right product in the right place. The best trade lubrication at the moment is to increase the service level^" said Subhashis Basu^ chief operating officer of Prataap Snacks^ which makes Yellow Diamond brand of salty snacks and chips.Dhairyashil Patil^ national president^ All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICF) said promotions targeting consumers and trade channels have vanished. Consumer promotions^ he added^ are down across categories including packaged foods as well as home care products^ as companies struggle to meet existing demand.“The focus is on ensuring retail coverage goes up and basic supplies are met. Once normalcy returns^ these offers will come back as they will be required to generate demand^" said Sunay Bhasin^ chief marketing officer^ MTR Foods.Parle’s Shah added since most FMCG firms are operating with half of their manpower^ there will be a demand-supply gap." However^ as you fill the channel pipeline and as stocks increase in the market^ you may see a bit of promotional intensity come back^ but not in the near term^" he said.While companies try to improve product availability^ the categories witnessing a slump in demand^ that is^ non-essentials or premium products^ could see promotions as firms try to liquidate stocks^ Parle’s Shah said.Companies are also feeling the strain on their finances since production and movement of goods are constrained.Market researcher Nielsen has slashed its annual outlook for the FMCG sector to 5-6% down from its previous estimates of 9-10%^ as it expects the pandemic to leave a far-reaching impact on the sector.“The dumping of offers that was happening pre-covid won’t happen at this point when finances are under pressure. Margins are required not just to recover from losses but also to survive^" said an executive at a packaged foods company who did not want to be named.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

This^ she said^ will put ₹50^000 crore in the hands of these people.The government also sought to put more cash in the hands of consumers by lowering their EPF contribution to boost take home pay. The Union government reduced the statutory EPF deductions for employers and employees to a total of 20% for the next three months. This will benefit around 650^000 companies and their employees. Currently^ employees and employers deposit 12% each of the basic salary and housing allowances as EPF every month. The move will thus reduce the employee cost for employers and give employees 2% more take home pay.It was encouraging to see the details of the stimulus^ said Simon George^ president at Cargill India^ a fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm.“We can see a two-pronged initiative from the government^ addressing both the demand and supply sides simultaneously to revive the economy. On the demand side^ reduction in PF contribution and tax cuts for non-salaried professionals will put more cash in the hands of end consumers. This should trigger a demand surge^" he said.The FMCG sector wants demand to revive as soon as possible^ said Angshu Mallick^ deputy chief executive officer^ Adani Wilmar Ltd^ a packaged foods company.“The finance minister’s announcements to lower TDS and TCS will boost liquidity and leave more money in the hands of people. This will spur spending^ which is the need of the hour to revive demand and economic activity^" he said.On the supply side^ George said support announced for MSMEs is a positive step.shuchi.b@livemint.comSubscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

For this^ traditional technology tools aren’t always feasible.“What is happening now is that companies are investing in low cost add-ons or hold-ons^ which are helping them monitor the constraints on a real-time basis^" Nanda said^ adding that emerging technologies^ such as artificial intelligence and blockchain^ will play a crucial role.“Covid has taught us to look at new ways of patternization^ understanding demand and supply and fulfilment^" said Easwaran P.S.^ Partner^ Deloitte India. “One of the big applications that’s coming up is artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based inventory optimization^" he added.Food products brand Parle and IBM are working together to create an “intelligent supply chain". They will make use of IBM’s Watson AI solution to predict demand^ reduce time-to-market and right-size its inventory across the supply chain.In the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector^ firms have rushed to tie-up with delivery platforms^ such as Zomato^ Swiggy and Dunzo^ to ensure their goods keep moving. These firms traditionally depended on neighbourhood mom-and-pop stores to meet the market demand.Big companies aside^ digital transformation extends right to the lowest levels of the supply chain right now.According to Pankaj Ghodde^ CEO of Agro10X^ he added over 100^000 new farmers to its platform in the past month-and-a-half. It had taken the platform six months to add the same number before the pandemic. “We had to actually put a load balance on our server because of the load coming from the platform^" he said.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

This resulted in a weak performance in our India business^ although we have continued to gain market shares across categories^" said Nisaba.According to the company^ its India business sales declined 18 per cent year-on-year^ led by 15 per cent year-on-year decline in volume.However^ its revenue from Indonesian market moved up 8.94 per cent to ₹449.36 crore as compared to ₹412.47 crore in the year-ago period.“In our international businesses^ Indonesia continued its strong growth momentum with mid-single digit profitable constant currency sales growth in spite of the covid-19 crisis^ driven by a consistent performance across categories and several go-to-market initiatives^" she said.Revenue from Africa (including Strength of Nature) market is down 17.55 at ₹484.03 crore as against ₹587.09 crore a year ago."In GAUM (Godrej Africa^ USA^ Middle East)^ we witnessed a weak sales performance amidst disruptions caused by covid-19 in many of our countries of operations^" Nisaba added.While revenue from other markets was marginally down at ₹135.90 crore as against ₹136.74 crore in January-March of FY 2018-19.According to the company^ in view of lockdown in the country^ operations in many of our locations (manufacturing^ warehouses^ offices^ etc) are scaled down or shut down from second half of March 2020.“Going forward^ we are ramping up our supply chain operations and distribution^ in line with the prescribed safety measures and easing of lockdowns in various countries. Since the situation is very dynamic^ our teams are continuing to manage our business prudently^ while assessing various scenarios for business recovery^" she said.“We will continue to focus on driving our market share and launch relevant innovations to enhance our competitiveness."GCPL's profit before tax for the January-March quarter was 337.39 crore as against ₹500.57 crore in the corresponding quarter a year earlier."During the year to date^ there has been sale of certain brands within the group’s entities that shall derive benefits of future tax deductions for the group.

2020-05-13,https://www.livemint.com//industry/retail/lockdown-fmcg-companies-see-surge-in-online-business-11589367472438.html,LiveMint,Lockdown: FMCG companies see surge in online business,NEW DELHI: India’s fast-moving consumer goods companies -- both big and small -- that have for years built expansive distribution networks through kirana shops and supermarkets said the covid-19 lockdown has given a fillip to online sales as shoppers stuck at home turned to buying essentials on the internet.The share of e-commerce in sales of fast-moving consumer goods in India remains extremely small^ with over 85% of sales coming from traditional retail that includes neighbourhood stores. Online sales were a mere 2.8% of the overall sales for FMCG companies in the first quarter of 2020^ according to estimates by market research agency Nielsen.For Bengaluru-headquartered MTR Foods^ sales via e-commerce moved up from 2.2% pre-covid to 4-5% now. This^ said a top executive at the company^ was driven by a new set of shoppers turning to online shopping."E-commerce fence-sitters have changed their behaviour^ and their experience has not been bad or dissatisfying^" said Sunay Bhasin^ marketing head at the company that makes a variety of packaged food products. "We have seen our e-commerce business double—we have done tie-ups and extended our own e-commerce play (owned website) to more cities and pin-codes."Beverage company Parle Agro that sells the popular Frooti and Appy Fizz brands has seen its online sales jump manifold. "We have already seen a 300% increase in sales on the e-commerce platform in the last month. Now^ with an increase in the number of platforms that we partner with online^ we are targeting ten-fold growth^" said Nadia Chauhan^ joint managing director and CMO^ Parle Agro.The company's brands are available on BigBasket^ Grofers^ Milk Basket and Flipkart. Tie-ups with Amazon and Zomato are on the anvil^ said Chauhan.It has also lined up specific stock keeping units and brands for e-commerce as it hopes to increase the contribution from online sales to 15%.Kerala-based packaged foods company Elite Foods saw a 100% jump in online sales in certain regions for its products that include cakes^ bread and buns^ Indian instant mixes^ speciality flours and a health range."But we faced some challenges^ such as lack of manpower^ no deliveries in containment zones and difficulty in securing entry to hotspots^ that prevented us from doing better business^" said Danesa Raghulal^ executive director^ Elite Foods. It continues to sell online via Swiggy and Big Basket. "We will also look at increasing our online business significantly in the future^" Raghulal said.The company’s products are available in 70^000 outlets in south India and Maharashtra.Research by Mintel suggests that online shopping became more popular during different phases of India’s lockdown. Around 41% of those surveyed by Mintel aged 35-54 had increased online shopping vis-a-vis 30% aged 18-34^ suggesting higher adoption among those who were previously averse to buying goods online.In a post-earnings call last month^ top executives at Hindustan Unilever (HUL) said they expect the pandemic to alter shopping behaviour^ with an uptick in online shopping as consumers avoid going out."We could see that the relevance of the humble grocers could go up. As people become averse to stepping out this should give a fillip to e-commerce and we would be ready for that^" Sanjiv Mehta^ chairman and managing director^ HUL^ said.Earlier this week^ Nestle India said contribution from e-commerce went up significantly during the March quarter.In its report on consumer behaviour during the pandemic^ Nielsen said the share of e-commerce in India’s top metros—Nielsen counts 52 cities as metros^ or those with a population greater than 10 lakh—went up from 5% in the January to March quarter of 2019 to 7.3% in the same period of the current year. Nielsen follows a January to December calendar.Capital Foods^ which sells under Ching's Secret and Smith & Jones brands^ said its share of online commerce doubled too^ growing from 2% to 4-4.5%.“There was some inertia initially when consumers were not exploring the e-commerce channel. But e-commerce has emerged as the great leveller^" said Navin Tewari^ chief executive at the company. Tewari expects the share of e-commerce to touch 10% of overall sales in FY21.However^ he said^ the company will continue to supply goods first to traditional trade channels and modern trade stores that still form the bulk of its sales.(Shuchi Bansal contributed to this story.)Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

The sell-off by FPIs^ because of steep valuations and poor macros^ intensified following the covid-19 outbreak^ slashing stakes in FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) and pharma stocks. This is in contrast to the 14.16% stake held by FIIs in these companies Q4FY19 and 13.36% last December^ according to data provided by Capitaline.“This could be attributed to FIIs going on a selling spree in the last week of February^ which lasted till April. While the Indian markets remained resilient initially^ it too came in the line of fire^ like other global markets^ by the covid-19 scare in the last week of February^" said Himanshu Srivastava^ senior analyst and manager research^ Morningstar Investment Adviser India.Uncertainty over the impact of covid-19 on the global and domestic economy prompted investors to adopt a cautious stance towards emerging markets such as India^ which are considered riskier destinations compared with the developed world during crises of global proportions^ said Srivastava.“When there is a flight to safety or when risk-taking is off the table^ investors usually shift their focus towards safe havens. This triggered an exodus of foreign investors from emerging markets and India was no different^" he said.In the first three months of 2020^ FIIs sold Indian shares worth $6.09 billion. They had got into a sell-off mode to the tune of $7.88 billion in March^ a month when Sensex dropped 26% in dollar terms and Indian currency depreciated.Sectorally^ FIIs reduced exposure mostly in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and pharma stocks. In March^ FPIs owned an aggregate 13.38% in FMCG stocks^ down from 15.10% in the year-ago period. Foreign investors cut stakes in pharma stocks to 14.77% in March quarter from 17.04% in same quarter last fiscal. Sector specific reasons along with worries of slowdown led to such a sharp sell-off^ analysts said.Among FMCGs^ FIIs reduced stake in ITC to 14.63% in March from 17.01% in year-ago period.Most of the cut in FMCG sectoral basis is led by ITC^ said Deepak Jasani^ Retail Research Head^ HDFC Securities. “Foreign investors are driven by ESG norms.

Environmental^ social^ and governance (ESG) refer to three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business.Pharma companies may have seen lower FII stake because of company specific reasons such as run-ins with the US Food and Drug Administration^ according to Jasani. In the pharma sector^ FIIs cut stake in heavyweights such as Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd^ Biocon Ltd^ Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd^ Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd^ and Divis Laboratories Ltd.Foreign investors are expected to evaluate how India unlocks business activities post lockdown^ number of cases in the country and economic growth path before taking a long-term investment plunge into the country^ said analysts.“These are unprecedented scenarios and dynamic in nature.

Some are operating at 50-70% of pre-covid production capacity.“As production was shut in March and April^ many people used their buffer stock. So^ April was good for all distributors^ because they were still receiving stocks. However^ since 25 April^ supplies have fallen^ especially in food." The situation will improve in eight to ten days^ Patil added.The problem is greater in the processed food segment^ where consumption has been high during the lockdown^ said Subhashis Basu^ chief operating officer^ Prataap Snacks^ which makes namkeen and chips.Food accounts for roughly 58% of the value of FMCG goods sold in India. Consumers stocked up on such items^ given the pivot towards home-cooking during the extended phase of the lockdown.Basu said the stock pipelines dried up and as production and logistics are not yet in full swing^ “there are some shortages in the market". The company is trying to ramp up production and supply chains^ he added.When the lockdown started on 25 March^ shoppers rushed to stores and bought household staples such as packaged flour^ rice^ cheese and breakfast cereals^ Nielsen said in the second edition of its covid-19 impact report on retail and FMCG in April.Companies were also forced to temporarily suspend operations in some plants and warehouses. This disrupted supplies of essentials during the first phase of the lockdown.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

Dabur^ too is reaching directly to retailers. The companies said this will help ensure supplies do not run out at a time when distributors and wholesalers^ key suppliers of packaged goods to retailers^ have been immobile because of lockdown restrictions.“We have commenced tele-servicing and introduced an app for retailers. This enables retail partners to feed in their requirement and place orders digitally or through a phone call at their convenience^" said Sanjay Mishra^ chief operating officer^ India sales and Bangladesh business^ Marico Limited. The facility is available for 80^000 top retailers of the company^ which makes the popular Saffola cooking oil and oats.“In some cases^ retailers are picking up stocks^ but we have gone ahead and extended the services of our third-party logistics partners to distributors also to ensure smooth movement of goods to the retailers^" Mishra said. This includes tie-ups with logistics companies such as Delhivery^ Shadowfax^ Lalamove and Zoomcar “to ensure products are delivered from factories to depots and thereafter to distributors"^ he said.The move^ said Mishra^ helped resolve problems at different levels in the distribution ecosystem and helped multiple distributors across regions to restart their business. Marico’s Saffola oils portfolio benefited in the three months ended 31 March as shoppers across India cooked more at home and stocked up on cooking oils. The company’s edible oils portfolio saw a 25% year-on-year volume^ even as its personal care portfolio gave a weak performance.“We are deploying new strategies and finding innovative solutions to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential products to our retail partners during these unprecedented times.

HUL is bringing relevant innovations in the market to service consumer needs in the short-to-medium term^ he had added.In the next few months^ the company plans to launch many items in the health and hygiene space such as Lifebuoy germ kill spray^ Domex disinfectant spray^ Domex germ-removal wipes^ Lifebuoy cloth sanitisers^ and an anti-germ variant under its Surf Excel brand. “We have launched a range of SKU's in sanitizers in record time^" Phatak added.Last month^ packaged consumer goods firm Dabur India Ltd said it has advanced the launch of an immunity-boosting health product given the new focus on preventive healthcare. It subsequently launched Dabur Tulsi Drops^ an immunity booster under its healthcare over-the-counter (OTC) portfolio.Covid-19 is swaying consumer behavior across the globe. With the deadly virus known to be highly contagious that stays on various surfaces—the use of surface disinfectants^ sanitizers^ germ-killing soaps^ and immunity-boosting products has seen a spike in demand. This trend is unlikely to diminish going forward.Companies such as ITC Ltd and CavinKare have rolled out surface disinfectants. ITC launched a Savlon-branded surface disinfectant spray^ after a hand sanitizing liquid^ Savlon Hexa.Packaged goods company^ CavinKare^ too has launched a gadget as well as surface disinfectant under the Bacto-V brand^ after rolling out hand sanitizers under its Nyle and Chik brands.“This pandemic has shown us the importance of cleaning and disinfecting in day-to-day life in order to reduce the spread of illness. We felt that launch of Bacto-V is a logical extension to our already launched sanitizers in our fight against covid-19^" said Venkatesh Vijayaraghavan^ director and chief executive officer (CEO)^ personal care and alliances^ CavinKare.Companies are also innovating with new product categories.“Increasingly^ both personal and domestic hygiene is becoming top priority for consumers^" packaged goods company Marico Ltd said while announcing the launch of 'Veggie Clean'^ a fruit and vegetable wash^ last week. This is after it entered the hand hygiene segment with Mediker hand sanitizer in India.The launches also corroborate with what consumers are expected to buy over the next few months.In its April report on covid-19 consumption habits in India^ market researcher Nieslen said over 55% consumers it surveyed intend to buy more personal hygiene and safety products going ahead. Another 56% said they will increase spends on healthy^ organic food^ medical needs^ fitness^ and mediclaim.Nielsen said there was an upswing in demand for products such as hand sanitizers^ floor cleaners^ and hand washes March onwards. The hand sanitizers category witnessed a growth of 340% in March across trade channels. This led to an unprecedented surge in the entry of new players—152—in this category.

2020-05-01,https://www.livemint.com//companies/people/-kirana-digitization-will-yield-insights-on-consumer-basket-11588348986937.html,LiveMint,‘Kirana digitization will yield insights on consumer basket’,With the friendly neighbourhood kirana stores stepping up efforts to service their customers during the lockdown^ Prasun Basu^ president (South Asia Zone) at research and information firm Nielsen Global Connect^ speaks of their performance vis-a-vis modern trade and e-commerce channels and why big retailers such as Amazon^ Flipkart and even Reliance Retail are betting on them. Edited excerpts from an interview:There’s a perception that kiranas have outperformed other channels during the lockdown.It is difficult to call out that the kiranas did better. Let me explain. Overall^ if you look at the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) industry^ the share of traditional trade—that is^ kiranas including panwallahs and chemists—is roughly 90%. Within that if you take out panwallahs and chemists^ it would be 70%. The reason everyone is jumping at it and the government is also creating these Suraksha Stores—which is a great effort—is because of the size of the market that is governed by the kiranas^ and not because the kiranas are becoming more salient. That is a bit of a myth.Kirana is the main avenue for trade and reaching goods to consumers. Having said that^ in the past two-three years^ the share of traditional trade has gone down from 92% to 87%. But even 87-88% is a huge number. That is why everyone^ including the government^ is so interested.If you ask me to future gaze^ I would say this share will go down to below 85% for sure in a year’s time. I won’t be surprised if it goes down to 80% also. But that does not mean that kirana is not the most important vehicle. Kiranas^ modern trade (such as supermarkets) and e-commerce are all creating a resurgence for themselves.What has been the growth rate of these channels?The month of March was a time of turmoil. During March^ traditional trade grew around 6-10% as pantry loading (stockpiling) by consumers had started happening. But in the same period^ modern trade grew in the range of 30-50% and e-commerce grew by 70-100%. That was till March 22—after which there was a slump for all.There is no problem in romancing the kiranas^ but the facts should be on the table. In the past one year^ FMCG had slowed down^ so traditional trade had grown only at 5% during December to February.Then why is there so much interest in kiranas?Pre-covid or post-covid^ it is really their proximity to consumers that is helping. That’s the main reason kiranas did well in March and April. Even modern trade has gone hyper-local in the past two years. That is^ from the big boxes (large format stores)^ they have gone into really small formats^ closer to the consumer in residential colonies. Kiranas are the heart of hyper-local. You call on the phone^ they deliver at home.During the lockdown^ what has helped the kiranas is the fact that consumers did not have to worry about taking their car out or travelling.E-commerce^ meanwhile^ suffered owing to last-mile logistics. Initially^ e-commerce was not part of essential services and could not deliver goods.So^ the consumers flocked to kiranas?The crowd that goes to kiranas and the crowd that goes to modern trade are different. It is a classic India versus Bharat story. Kiranas are Bharat. These people from Bharat cannot do pantry loading with four to six weeks of supplies. They go to the kiranas for daily groceries.That is the dynamic that played. That’s why you see people flocking to kiranas.What is attracting companies such as Reliance Retail and Amazon to kiranas?If India’s post office network was re-groomed in our world^ imagine what it could have done. The kirana network is similar. We go to our panel of 40^000 stores every month for FMCG update so that our numbers are authentic. If you include chemists and ‘paan plus’ (paanwallahs who stock chips^ chocolates and other products)^ there are 10 million outlets. If you look at just kiranas^ there are 7 million.That’s why all the companies are talking to them—it’s not for their momentum but for their size^ network and hyper-local nature.If Amazon^ Flipkart or Reliance tie up with kiranas^ the last-mile fulfilment is easy. They can pipe in products into these kiranas.The kiranas also know the assortment in the consumer’s basket that sells in the neighbourhood. If you digitize kiranas^ then understanding of the consumer basket that sells in the hyper-local area will be easy to access. You will know what Bandra East buys versus Bandra West.Our estimate is that currently only 5-10% kiranas are digitized. This will go up. Digitization will also help streamline the supply side. Once the stock is sold^ automatic replenishment cues can go out online.Right now^ a salesperson and the wholesaler come with their khaata (accounts book)and they take down orders laboriously.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

The market researcher said that long-term effects of the pandemic will have widespread impact in the months to come.The projections came on the day that India’s largest packaged consumer goods maker^ Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL)^ a bellwether for the packaged goods industry^ reported a steep decline in volumes. On Thursday^ HUL reported a 7% decline in underlying volume growth for the quarter ended 31 March.The massive disruption because of the pandemic comes just as the industry was seeing early signs of demand recovery in January and February.A nationwide lockdown to limit the spread of the coronavirus towards the end of March^ Nielsen said^ impacted quarterly growth rates.“We came through a difficult last year^ where we were in a downturn^ but we felt the markets were firming up^" Prasun Basu^ South Asia zone president of Nielsen Global Connect^ told reporters on a conference call.However^ the covid-19 outbreak disrupted this trend in March^ Nielsen’s report said.In the quarter ended March^ India’s FMCG sector grew 6.3% (including e-commerce) in value terms^ down sharply from the 13.8% growth the sector saw in the year-ago period. While January and February saw growth rates improve from the December quarter^ the spread of covid-19 in March sharply impacted sales.In the month of March^ volumes grew by a mere 0.5%^ while the sector clocked a value growth of 4%. The initial recovery in January and February was driven by food categories^ Nielsen said.Demand for packaged foods and staples—that contribute 58% to overall FMCG sales (value terms)—grew by 7.8% in the first quarter of 2020^ slightly slower than the 8.3% growth rate clocked in the December quarter; while non-food categories grew by a mere 1.8% in value.The trend points to early stocking up by Indian households that began in the month of March^ when shoppers bought large packages of cooking oil^ flour^ rice^ dal^ staples^ and household cleaning products as they prepared to stay at home during the lockdown.Nielsen projections point to yet another gloomy year for the large consumption driven sector that was reeling from sluggish growth^ especially in the hinterland. The covid-19 crisis and India’s lockdown imposed in the month of March prompted several large FMCG companies to temporarily shutter or scale down operations at their manufacturing plants and warehouses.While capacities have gradually improved^ companies are still running at sub-optimum production levels^ and pushing sales of largely essential items. Moreover^ restricted vehicle movement has prevented supplies from reaching distributors and retailers.Meanwhile^ shoppers in India’s metro cities are increasingly shifting to supermarket chains^ and even ordering their groceries online^ prompting the two organized retail formats to corner a bigger share in the sale of fast moving consumer goods in a county where local grocery stores still control a bulk of the market.In all^ the two formats now account for roughly 30% of FMCG sales in the country’s metros^ Nielsen said on Thursday. Nielsen counts 52 cities as metros^ or those with a population of more a million.Nielsen said that in the first quarter of 2020^ share of modern trade stores in these metro cities moved up from 22.3% in the same period a year ago to 24.7% now; while that of e-commerce went up from 5% in the January to March quarter of 2019 to 7.3% in the same period of the current year.

Nielsen follows a January to December calendar.In a quarterly update on India's FMCG sector^ the market researcher assessed the contribution and growth rates of traditional trade^ modern retail^ and e-commerce sales channels to FMCG sales in India. The researcher looked at retail channels in India's metros^ as well as mapped their popularity pan-India.However^ across India^ traditional trade still continues to control bulk of stores where goods of daily use are bought and sold.Across India^ in terms of their contribution to FMCG sales^ the share of traditional trade—still the largest—dropped from 88.5% in the first quarter of 2019^ to 86.3% in the first quarter 2020^ shrinking by 2.2% in the span of a year. Whereas the share of modern trade moved up from 9.6% in Q1'19 to 10.9% in Q1'20. Across India though^ contribution of e-commerce is still minuscule at 2.8%."The contribution or the channel mix (of different retail channels) has been changing over the last one year. Traditional retail has come down to 86%^ so there is clearly some movement towards organized trade^ and within organized trade^ both modern trade and e-commerce are taking share for now^" said Sharang Pant^ lead retail vertical and RMS^ Nielsen Global Connect.However^ Nielsen said the “channel shifts are even more amplified in metros where traditional trade salience has dropped by almost five percentage points in the last one year."Now^ as Covid-19 sways shopping behavior prompting more consumers to avoid crowded places^ it is likely to boost adoption of online retailing in India. Online grocery retailers such as Grofers^ and BigBasket have been overwhelmed with orders since India’s strict lockdown started.Large marketplaces like Amazon^ and Flipkart^ too^ are currently engaged in the delivery of essentials.The demand has also prompted more industry players to join in—FMCG companies^ and physical retail stores too have amped up their presence online with new apps^ and tie-ups with logistics companies for home deliveries.Nielsen also said that over the years^ modern retail chains have drawn in huge numbers especially through their own sales and promotional activities such as celebrating key occasions—what Nielsen calls ‘big days’. These include sales around Republic and Independence day that have become significant.“Retailer driven ‘big days’ have played a big role in this performance of organised trade channels^ modern trade and e-commerce^ in Q1’20. Organised channels witnessed consistent “double-digit" growth in the ‘big day’ months^ indicating that ‘big day’s’ could be an important lever to drive growth for the FMCG industry in future months^" it said.It^ however^ added that e-commerce ‘big-days’ have progressively outperformed modern trade.In a post-earnings call on Thursday^ top executives at Hindustan Unilever Ltd said that going forward they expect the covid-19 pandemic to alter shopping behavior^ among them an uptick in online shopping as consumers avoid going out.“We could see that relevance the humble grocers could go up^ and there could be a renaissance of that. Secondly^ of course^ would be on e-commerce certainly. As people become averse to stepping out this should give a fillip to e-commerce and we would be ready for that^" Sanjiv Mehta^ Chairman and Managing Director^ HUL^ said.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

GSK received the shares earlier this month in return for the sale of its Indian consumer business to HUL.The two multinational giants had announced the all-share deal worth ₹31^700 crore ($3.8 billion) in December 2018. Bloomberg first reported on Wednesday that GSK was in discussions with its advisers on when to launch the transaction.In a statement on 1 April^ Glaxo said HUL has paid it an extra ₹3^045 crore (approximately $400 million) crore to acquire the Horlicks brand for India^ after seeking approval from the board of HUL^ exercising the option available in the original agreement made between Unilever and GSK.GSK Consumer Healthcare’s brands such as Horlicks^ Boost and Maltova are now part of HUL’s food and refreshments business in the nutrition category. As part of the merger^ 3^500 GSK employees will also become part of the Indian arm of the Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever. Under the deal^ HUL will distribute GSK’s brands such as Eno^ Crocin^ Sensodyne^ etc. in the country.“GSK’s intent was to start selling its shares as and when the merger was consummated. They will sell the shares in parts over a period of time^ given the size of the stake they hold. Investment banks JP Morgan^ Morgan Stanley and others are advising GSK on this share sale^" the person cited earlier said^ requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters. GSK did not respond to a request for comment.No final decision has been taken on the timing of the proposed sale^ and Glaxo could decide to postpone the sale depending on market conditions and investor demand^ Bloomberg reported^ citing people it did not name.“GSK intends to monetise its holding in HUL at such time it considers appropriate^ taking into account market conditions^" GSK had said after the completion of the merger.Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan declined to comment.GSK’s plan to sell the HUL shares comes at a time when the FMCG major’s stock has been one of the outperformers in a market ravaged by the covid-19 pandemic.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

2020-04-29,https://www.livemint.com//industry/retail/fmcg-makers-tighten-supplies-to-future-over-delay-in-payments-11588099896114.html,LiveMint,FMCG makers tighten supplies to Future Retail over delay in payments,NEW DELHI : Large- to mid-sized household goods makers and their distributors have become wary of selling goods to Future group’s EasyDay and Big Bazaar chain stores^ with some of these companies saying that they are facing unusually long delays in receiving payments for the supply of goods. As such^ some of them are selling limited inventory until the outstandings are cleared.This highlights the cash flow woes and debt-related troubles of Future group^ said top executives at fast-moving consumer goods companies. Big Bazaar^ which has more than 300 stores in the country^ and EasyDay^ with approximately 500 stores^ are run by Future Retail Ltd.“For the last few months^ they are facing a severe cash crunch…our payments are pending for more than a few months now^" said a top executive at a packaged foods company on condition of anonymity. The company has not cut off supplies but is “pressing them hard for payments"^ said the executive.Most retailers work on a credit cycle of buying stock from manufacturers directly or through distributors and pay them after a stipulated period. In case of modern retailers^ the credit period would ideally be between 25 and 45 days and can even stretch to 60 days in some cases. The credit period depends on the companies they deal with and the areas they service.Covid-19 has pushed other retailers to also seek more time to make payments^ but Future group’s grocery formats have been unusually late^ according to several companies.“We have been writing emails about our outstanding dues pan-India^" said a top executive at another mid-sized packaged foods company. However^ there has been no response^ said the executive. The company’s dues^ which are typically cleared in 45 days^ haven’t been cleared in more than 90 days^ said the executive.“Some retailers asked for extra credit. In some cases we have agreed to an additional 30-day period. However^ their (Future group’s) delays go beyond that^" said the executive.Future group accounts for a significant chunk of the company’s sale to modern trade formats^ the executive said^ adding that it is not considering pulling out its stocks.There are^ however^ heightened concerns about the group’s ability to pay^ especially as the stores are functioning amid tight restrictions and reduced timings^ the executive said.A Future group spokesperson did not respond to email queries.Some other companies that supply goods to Future group said they will work within strict credit cycles and take “limited risk". “We are more careful with them right now. We are following up on our payments. There were some problems earlier also^ but March onwards^ it is more critical^" said a director at another FMCG company who did not want to be named. Other retailers are seeking a relaxation in payment schedules^ but those^ he said^ are for a few days.“We only processed orders once our pending payments were released and only sent limited stocks^" said another executive at a diversified FMCG company.The woes of FMCG companies come at a time when Future group is struggling with mounting debt. The covid-19 pandemic has caused long-term store closures across the group’s apparel^ fashion^ and other high-margin verticals^ leaving only its grocery business to operate.Group promoter Kishore Biyani’s debt-related troubles came to the fore in March^ when shares of Future group’s listed company lost significant value^ leading to a rating downgrade of his promoter holding company and invocation of pledged shares by lenders. The group has moved to find buyers for promoter shares in two group entities.On 25 March^ Mint reported that Future group had appointed investment bank Arpwood Capital to find a buyer for the apparel business^ Future Lifestyle Fashion Ltd^ which runs the Central brand of apparel retail stores. Bloomberg reported on 9 April that the group aims to raise ₹2^500 crore by selling its stake in an insurance joint venture.“If within your portfolio you are only selling grocery and staples and you cannot sell all the profitable things such as apparel^ the situation will become bad^" said the first executive cited above.Distributors and vendors who are squeezed for sales would rather sell to retailers who are offering better terms or upfront cash payments^ said a person who works with large distributors.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

But it is capital-intensive and may not be the best option right now. We are also considering doing something in personal hygiene products or in the Ayurvedic space and research is on. But whatever we do^ it will take time^" said Shankar^ whose wife works in a top IT firm.The virus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown are slowly pushing companies to downsize or streamline operations and workforces across the country. Urban unemployment rates have also been rising. Startup unicorns such as Swiggy and Oyo are laying off people to cut costs as demand remains muted.According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s weekly tracker survey estimates^ overall unemployment for the week ended 19 April shot up to 26.19% from 8.4% in mid-March. Urban unemployment rose to 25.08% from 8.66% during the same period.Santhosh Goteti^ 27^ lost his job with Oyo in February-end. He was among 10 people who were retrenched from Oyo’s Japan team. The company is in crisis and you have to accept it and move on^ said Goteti^ who is now living with his parents in Visakhapatnam.A construction engineer^ Goteti has been looking at roles of business development in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector. “All construction activities have stopped after the lockdown and I don’t know when it will restart. So^ I am looking at roles in hospitality and FMCG^" he says. He’s also working on getting PRINCE2^ a project management certification^ online. “I registered for it in October but didn’t find time. Now I am dedicating all my time to it^" he says.Durlabh^ who worked as UX researcher with a mobility startup in Bengaluru^ was laid off mid-March. He had been working at the organization for nearly a year. Currently^ he's considering pivoting to a related but different role in the design field. "I am looking at design roles^" he says."With the current situation^ the number of UX design and research roles has decreased considerably. It also feels risky to do UX research job due to the requirement of public interaction^ even after the lockdown is lifted. So it's better to broaden the design roles I am looking for^" says Durlabh^ 28^ who received a three months severance package.Anshul Lodha^ regional director at executive search firm Michael Page^ said there are limited job openings and those who are hiring belong to the pharma^ ed-tech^ health tech and chemicals sectors.“It will be relatively easier for younger professionals to pivot and switch to a different industry. They can learn new skills and move to an alternative career path. There is also demand for experienced^ senior-level hiring. However^ mid-level employees^ in the salary bracket of ₹30-60 lakh^ will have a tough time as hiring is slow in this category and it won’t be easy for them to suddenly learn new skills^" Lodha said.Two days after the lockdown was announced^ Preeti Negi^ 31^ was asked to leave the job she had held for two years because the Delhi-based startup was in the red. A week earlier^ Negi^ already aware of the company’s dire straits^ had reached the final round of a job interview at a Gurugram-based startup. On 31 March^ Negi^ a weather researcher^ received an email from the potential employer saying recruitment had been put on hold. “I have savings to last me two months. This is the first time I haven’t had a job since I left college 10 years ago^" she says.Negi spends the day on LinkedIn applying for jobs^ but to counter the anxiety and to open up more opportunities^ she’s learning German online. She’s hoping the new skill will give her an edge when the job market opens up again. “I’m worried^ yes^ and everything is so uncertain^ but I’m also using the time to learn something new. Maybe it’ll lead to new opportunities and possibilities."Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

While we have witnessed good demand across the country^ the other two aspects pose a challenge^" said Navin Tewari^ CEO^ Capital Foods^ that sells Ching's Secret and Smith & Jones brands. The company is already operating at 70% of its capacity in certain product categories^ however with 45% workforce. "Today all our plants are operational but one^" said Tewari.He added that migration of workers and restrictions on the movement of people across cities have dented availability of manpower. “We have seen a phenomenal response from the central government and its various departments^ but percolation down of information to local administrative authorities and their internal coordination needs to be strengthened^" said Tewari.Companies that supply essential goods such as packaged foods^ soaps^ personal hygiene products^ shampoos etc^ have received permission to partially resume production they said that there were gaps in the supply chain—for instance availability of raw and packaging material.India’s largest packaged consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) said that it continues to face a shortage in manpower despite its factories commencing operations partially.“Most of our factories^ many of our distribution centres and majority of our suppliers are operating^ but not at their full capacity^" a company spokesperson told PTI. The spokesperson further added that "We continue to work with local and state government authorities to get our operations towards the required capacity that the people in our country expect from us."Earlier this week^ packaged goods company Dabur said that while almost all of its factories are operational—producing a range of Ayurvedic medicines^ hand sanitisers^ hand wash and daily essentials—it is now trying to maximise production given the supply chain constraints^ and material and manpower availability^ Shahrukh Khan^ executive director-operations^ Dabur India said.Khan added that forced closure of some of its suppliers' factories (largely MSMEs) was affecting the smooth functioning of its supply chain^ especially in areas that are designated hot spots.On Wednesday^ packaged food and beverage company^ Nestle India^ said it has received permission to operate all manufacturing units in the country—that are now operating at scaled down levels. In a filing to the BSE^ the maker of Maggi noodles^ and Kit Kat chocolates said that most of the company's distribution centers and warehouses^ and suppliers too were operating at scaled down levels^ keeping in mind social distancing norms and lesser deployment of people.It added that it will rely on further central and state government directive before “scaling up^ scaling down or suspending of operations at various locations".Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

2020-04-21,https://www.livemint.com//news/india/fmcg-firms-ride-on-delivery-apps-to-break-the-lockdown-11587456836219.html,LiveMint,FMCG firms ride on delivery apps to break the lockdown,Consumer goods companies facing broken supply-chain networks are forging new linkages with food aggregators^ hyperlocal apps and courier firms^ reshaping the old model of depending solely on wholesalers^ distributors and retail stores to reach customers. Tele-services and apps to help retailers place orders are also being rolled out^ as India nears a month of lockdown to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.The lockdown has disrupted traditional supply chains as distributors^ wholesalers and direct sales staff were hamstrung by severe traffic curbs and shortage of staff and vehicles.Adani Wilmar^ which sells edible oil and other staples under the Fortune brand^ has tied up with Justmyroots^ which delivers fruits and vegetables in Ahmedabad^ Kolkata^ Gurugram and Mumbai. The move comes days after it partnered online food aggregator Swiggy to deliver its products.Marico Ltd^ the maker of Saffola cooking oil^ said it reached out to Swiggy and Zomato in the early days of the lockdown itself^ sensing the demand for its brands. Later^ it tied up with courier firm Lalamove^ logistics firm Delhivery and business-to-business delivery firm Shadowfax^ even as its traditional supply chain struggled.“These logistics firms are using their own vehicle network to deliver goods to retailers^" said Sanjay Mishra^ chief operating officer^ India sales and Bangladesh business^ Marico Ltd. Marico also moved to enable its call centres—previously used to resolve customer queries—to address supply issues faced by retailers and rolled out a retailer-facing app. “These call centres now have the capability to capture orders from retailers and pass them back to the company^" said Mishra^ adding the model is still a work-in-progress.MyGate^ an app that services 7^000 housing societies started talks with online grocery firm Grofers^ and packaged goods firm ITC a few weeks ago. So far^ the app has enabled grocery ordering in over 1^100 societies in metros. MyGate allows Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) to take orders and pass it on to say^ ITC Ltd^ helping fulfil orders for its Aashirvaad-branded atta^ ghee^ spices^ Yippee noodles^ Sunfeast biscuits^ Fiama and Vivel soaps^ among others. MyGate is now in talks with several other companies.ITC has also forged associations with delivery apps of pizza chain Domino’s^ Swiggy and Zomato^ apart from community-centric apps. It has also partnered with delivery service provider Dunzo and is also allowing consumers to shop online though ITCstore.in.“Many of these emerging channels are likely to become mainstream in the new normal even after the pandemic is behind us^" a spokesperson said.Earlier this month^ in a pilot^ groceries and food retailer Spencer’s Retail tied up with e-commerce platform Flipkart to use the latter’s fleet to deliver goods. “The key challenge was availability of manpower^ and since public transport was not functioning^ we tied up with third-party players Shadowfax^ Uber^ Delhivery and Flipkart^" said Shashwat Goenka^ sector head^ Spencer’s Retail.Even as retailers rush to plug supply gaps^ it remains to be seen whether these tie-ups will stick once the lockdown curbs are lifted.

2020-04-18,https://www.livemint.com//industry/retail/regional-fmcg-brands-count-the-cost-of-lockdown-extension-11587151411176.html,LiveMint,Regional FMCG brands count the cost of lockdown extension,On his LinkedIn page^ Shashi Kumar^ co-founder^ Akshayakalpa Organic Milk^ says: “We are Hiring". This is indeed a rarity in these times^ when the covid-19 outbreak has caused major disruptions across industries.However^ for Kumar^ it’s time to expand his business^ with the demand for organic milk shooting up in major metropolises.In fact^ Kumar is short-staffed and needs at least 800 delivery boys to keep up with the demand from Bengaluru and Chennai^ the two cities it operates in.“When the lockdown was announced^ 600 of them left for their villages. We recruited a few^ but we are still short of 300 delivery boys^" he said.The extension of the lockdown has^ however^ been a damper. Though he is running the factory at full capacity^ the supply of packaging material from Delhi and antibiotic test kits for organic products have been severely disrupted.Many regional FMCG businesses face similar headwinds. While larger companies with higher cash cushions can ride out the lockdown^ small and medium enterprises have been hit the hardest due to manpower constraints^ and low supplies and^ for some^ declining sales.Akshayakalpa closed 2019-20 with a revenue of ₹65 crore. Sales will be significantly hit^ by about 40%^ this year^ Kumar said.Likewise^ Sleepy Owl Coffee^ which started India’s first cold brew coffee brand a few years ago^ said sales will be muted in 2020-21. The firm had clocked a revenue of about ₹7 crore in FY20. The extension of the lockdown impacts both the company’s distribution as well as the supply of raw material.“It would take longer for the online sales channels to open up^" Ajai Thandi^ co-founder^ Sleepy Owl Coffee^ said. “We will also run out of coffee and packaging material."The company’s coffee is sourced and roasted in Karnataka’s Chikmagalur. He has enough inventory to last till April-end. “We had ordered more inventory but some of it is stuck on the highways."Tabp^ a Coimbatore-based FMCG company^ targets the bottom-of-the-pyramid segment^ such as daily wagers earning^ say^ ₹300 a day. Under the brand Plunge^ Tabp sells apple^ guava and mango juices^ as well as carbonated drinks^ in the rural and urban poor markets of Tamil Nadu. The extension of the lockdown is a near washout of the summer business.“March to May is peak time for our business and contributes 50-60% of sales. People are avoiding anything cold ever since covid-19 stuck. This year’s turnover will be much lower^" Prabhu Gandhikumar^ founder^ Tabp^ said. It had clocked revenue of ₹12 crore in 2019-20. “We could pay last month’s salaries. But we have zero cash now^" he added.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

Consumers have stocked up on essential goods such as packaged rice^ wheat and soap^ Nielsen said in the second edition of its report on the impact of covid-19 on fast moving consumer goods and retail.The online survey was conducted by Nielsen between 10 April and 14 April among 1^330 people in 23 cities.The future is tilting toward home-cooked meals rather than eating out. People are cooking more at home and making healthy food as they are staying at home^ said Sanjay Mishra^ chief operating officer^ Marico India^ which makes Saffola cooking oil and oats. Hygiene has also become a big issue with increased awareness and is likely to remain the trend once the pandemic is over^ probably affecting eating out initially.“Brands will have to work harder to earn the trust of their consumers while continuing to be relevant to their needs^" said Pizza Hut’s director of marketing^ Neha^ who uses only her first name. “At Pizza Hut^ deliveries will continue to see an uptick and we are geared to handle that surge with technology upgradations^ oven-to-home contactless processes^ and delivery-centric value deals. Subsequently^ we are confident that dine-in will pick up as consumers will look forward to the sheer delight of eating out^" she said.Even if normalcy returns and the lockdown is relaxed^ people will not be comfortable in crowded places^ including airlines^ restaurants^ clubs^ and metros^ said Sameer Shukla^ west market leader^ South Asia^ Nielsen Global Connect. “How various service providers cater to this ‘new normal’ in terms of providing these goods and services in a hygienic and controlled environment will be future opportunities for brands^" he said.In the Nielsen survey^ 43% people also said they will defer spending on fashion^ personal grooming and home décor. Surprisingly^ 54% plan to decrease spend on automobiles^ a category otherwise expected to do well post covid-19 as consumers take steps to avoid using public transport and shared cabs. This is because of the climate of economic uncertainty^ said Shukla. The same percentage of respondents also said they will spend less on luxury products and leisure travel.In a behavioural shift^ consumers are willing to spend more on personal hygiene and safety products^ with 56% of respondents saying they will increase spends on healthy^ organic food^ medical needs^ fitness and medical insurance.The importance of preventive healthcare will grow in consumer priorities because of the covid-19 pandemic^ said Dabur chief executive officer Mohit Malhotra. People are expected to turn to more immunity boosting^ personal hygiene^ and nutrition products^ he said.A spokesperson for Hindustan Unilever Ltd^ which has acquired brands such as Horlicks and Boost^ also said that it will leverage the “mega trend of health and wellness" in India.The month of March saw a spike in the sale of hand sanitizers by 340% over the December-January-Feburary period. The hand wash category grew by 60% and floor cleaners by 24%. As per the Nielsen report^ the sale of branded honey in modern trade outlets grew by 35% in March^ Chyavanprash by 81% and turmeric by 38%. Interestingly^ the survey findings show that more people hope to increase their spends on online purchases^ with 39% saying they will increase online shopping by 20%^ a finding that augurs well for the e-commerce companies.E-commerce has seen exponential growth and this will continue^ said Prasun Basu^ president^ South Asia^ Nielsen. In the last decade^ the share of traditional trade (kirana stores) had gone down from 94% to 88%^ he said. However^ after the coronavirus outbreak and the ensuing lockdown^ kirana stores have made a comeback.“Yes^ e-commerce^ on small base^ will grow well. So will modern trade^ which has seen good growth in the last few months. However^ the world will definitely be run in a major way by traditional retailers and kirana stores that will be able to satisfy the needs of consumers^" said Basu.Nielsen expects a lot of innovation coming in the traditional trade model. For instance^ MaxWholesale^ a B2B e-commerce platform for kirana stores to source online inventory has launched an app that allows consumers to get in touch with their kirana stores and local retailers. The hyper-local app Radius allows kirana stores to share their catalogue with the neighbourhood^ connect with their customers to receive orders and payments.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

(India) Ltd are on the initial list^ said industry executives aware of the government’s plans. Initially^ one million stores will be covered^ as per the plans of the Union consumer affairs ministry.The companies will adopt neighbourhood stores and help them with education and certification on safety and hygiene standards. They will do so by working through their network of distributors.Later^ 40-50 more companies will join the initiative.“The initiative called Suraksha Stores is a joint attempt by the government and leading FMCG companies to convert the neighbourhood kirana stores into sanitized retail outlets selling daily essentials^ while adhering to safety norms such as social distancing and sanitization. This^ I feel^ will also go a long way in controlling the spread of covid-19 in India. We are also extending this to cover ayurveda outlets across India^" said Dabur India CEO Mohit Malhotra. Retailers can sign up on SurakshaStore.com for certification.“Aarogya Setu-compliant Suraksha Store is a public-private initiative to ensure that we can create a safe and secure environment for our consumers and shop owners at our kirana stores. A Suraksha Store is a store (kirana^ pharmacy^ consumer touchpoint) that follows 100% Suraksha safety norms. These stores shall be educated^ certified and validated to follow all common minimum health standards as well as safety checklists. Some companies have adopted states^" according to details listed on the Suraksha Stores website.The store must sign up for certification^ complete a training and pass an assessment^ which will then be verified by a local distributor. The store staff will need to use sanitizers and masks^ and follow social distancing norms. They will also be prompted to install the government’s contact tracing app^ Aarogya Setu.An ITC spokesperson welcomes the initiative.India’s supply chain for essentials has remained disrupted as a 21-day lockdown prompted firms to temporarily suspend production at their facilities.

They are also working on more tie-ups with last-mile delivery firms as transportation challenges still pose hurdles to the availability of goods in stores.“We have planned to gear up our joint virtual war room with manufacturers to ensure smooth supply chain planning of essentials. Given that people have taken some essentials^ now they also plan to buy more food range of snacks and summer drinks whose demand is slowly on the rise^" said Spencer’s Retail managing director and CEO Devendra Chawla.A dedicated fleet of vehicles has been bringing his staff to work every day^ said Chawla. Thus^ the chain that runs supermarkets across India is operating more than 90% of its stores at present.The chain has also expanded the reach of its e-commerce and phone delivery services manifold^ he said.The Centre is expected to announce interim measures for sectors hit hard by the virus outbreak as it lends relief to manufacturing sectors that employ millions^ Mint reported on Tuesday. This is all the more significant with the lockdown being extended and a stricter lockdown being put in place till 20 April.Mint had earlier reported that the department for promotion of industry and internal Trade (DPIIT) had asked the Union home ministry to partially allow industries such as textiles^ automobiles and electronic manufacturing to function. However^ these demands are yet to be met.“We are more prepared for the second phase of the lockdown than the first phase^ which saw huge disruptions in the supply chain... e-commerce was closed for 15 to 16 days. Now^ they are starting operations again. So^ that should help fulfil the consumer demand^" said Ritesh Arora^ head^ India and the Far East^ LT Foods^ which makes Daawat^ a packaged rice.“In the next 19 days^ the government should ensure that there is a standard operating procedure across India^" said Amrinder Singh^ director^ Bonn Group of Industries^ which makes a variety of food products^ including bread^ biscuits and cookies.With on-ground availability of workers still a challenge^ companies hope the government will allow longer work hours at plants so that supply can be increased.Companies that had scaled down operations now aim to increase capacity utilization to 50% over the next five weeks. “And then if some clarity can be reached and the government can allow us 12 hour shift we can build more supplies^" said an executive at a packaged goods company.Firms are also struggling with severe shortage of manpower in their production facilities.“Labour availability is still a challenge. However^ if some messaging can be made by the government asking people to resume work and urging companies to give them the assurance that they will follow all safety measures^ I hope labour will start coming in^" said the executive on condition of anonymity.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
2020-04-14,https://www.livemint.com//opinion/online-views/opinion-food-processing-sector-after-lockdown-11586876277950.html,LiveMint,Opinion | Food processing sector after lockdown,Not just agriculture but all agribusiness is critical for our survival. Primary processing like dairy milk^ bakery and vegetable oils are afloat^ albeit with 20-25% hit. Since consumption has also declined there is an edgy balance struck. Secondary processing sectors like chocolates^ sauces^ cheese etc. have seen much worse hit as consumers have pruned their consumption to conserve cash.However^ consumerism and demographic pluses will pull up all 25 sub-sectors of food processing to bounce back strongly and can be the flag bearer for the economy. With its predictable growth trajectory^ government should be “ready and willing" to support it fully recognizing that the “pay back" will be short due to:(i) Sustained and irreversible consumer demand(ii) Faster growth in value added production and thus higher contribution to exchequer and(iii) Exponential export potential and^ importantly^(iv) Huge employment potential.I expect that primary processing sectors will grow at 5 to 7% q-on-q after the lockdown while secondary processing sectors will grow at 10-15% q-on-q for 12 months post lock down and thereafter with a stable CAGR levels of 7-10% and 15-20% respectively for next at least 5 years: The reasons for my optimism are 4-fold(i) quick restoration of disposable incomes of the consuming (middle) class(ii) reserved demand of consumers for processed foods(iii) robust supply chains after Covid-19 experience and(iv) re-opening of retail outlets and Malls.For (i) an economic package should be hastened^ and retail lending should be kick started with Government sharing the risk with Banks. Consumers can pull the entire value chain to life from morbidity. For (ii) lessons being learnt each day will help make chains robust for tomorrow. If there is no half measures and no red tape^ the following should help:Firstly^ liquidity is badly squeezed as almost all food processing companies since (i) bank limits are fully drawn and (ii) collections are poor^ thus incapacitating payments including to workers. Since the sector is very manpower intensive^ there is a risk of social unrest. Banks should extend “soft" working capital for these companies literally overnight. As a thumb rule^ Banks to extend adhoc increases of 25% of all working capital limits for all “standard" (not NPA) food processing companies^ irrespective of their size across the Board for 12months on existing collaterals. Government can backstop losses from such adhoc increases upto 50%. Presently^ RBI has directed Banks to extend a moratorium on interest for the quarter April-June. This will not be enough. Banks should:(i) waive and not defer interest during this quarter(ii) reduce rate of interest to 5% for all facilities for next 3 quarters to help sector cater to an expected steep demandSecondly^ insurance companies should (i) cover inventory losses in the definition of STFI (natural calamity) (ii) waive premium for the Covid-19 duration and then re-start premium on a graded basis over next 3 quarters (iii) accept value loss of inventories liberally in next 3 quarters to allow for uncertain demand forecast.Thirdly^ Utilities should subsidize power charges:(i) Waive fixed load charge for next 12 months(ii) Reduce tariff by 50% for 2 quarters post lockdown and by 25% for subsequent 2 quartersFourthly^ production and productivity are key for which workers have to be satisfied. Their payments can be come from through Insurance companies like ESIC/LIC against a backstop of Government.Next^ consumer demand has to be fostered to pull up all supply chains for “greater good" of the country (i) GST reduction/deferment should be across companies in food processing (not just MSMEs) (ii) MOFPI should start granting 50% subsidy on frozen/chilled infrastructure (last mile) for traditional trade to handle the expected surge in demand for RTC/RTE/Frozen foods^ boosted also by a humbled restaurant sector^ whose revival is hinging on dissipation of “social distancing". Finally^ RBI has to focus on the widening credit gap ( ₹2lac crores last count) in food processing and incentivize Banks to lend. For one^ food processing should have its own separate 5% quota in the overall 40% priority sector credit quota instead of including it in overall 18% agriculture credit quota.Not to miss^ India is enviably poised to capitalize on:1) Global food production is estimated to decline and global demand for processed (ready to eat^ convenience and frozen) is poised to be transferred to India from Europe^ Australia and UK to India; and2) Global companies^ especially from US^ will either shift from China or replicate their manufacturing/production bases in India^ thus bringing in FDI.Like India^ food processing sector is destined to grow!Rajesh Srivastava is Executive Chairman^ Rabo Equity Advisors.

2020-04-14,https://www.livemint.com//news/india/india-readies-for-calibrated-opening-up-of-economy-11586807043738.html,LiveMint,India readies for calibrated opening up of economy,India plans to slowly reopen its economy^ while maintaining stringent curbs in covid-19 hotspots^ as the government aims to restart industrial activity after a 21-day lockdown and prevent the current upheaval from devolving into a deeper social crisis with millions of poor left hungry and jobless.Expectations of a massive fiscal stimulus package to revive economic activity and provide jobs and income to affected people have risen with Prime Minister Narendra Modi scheduled to address the nation at 10 am on Tuesday^ the last day of the 21-day initial lockdown.Key sectors of the economy such as farming^ agro-processing and household goods^ which meet essential needs of people and act as engines of growth^ will be gradually opened up with states and district administrations^ in coordination with the Centre^ deciding on how to return to normalcy in a graded manner^ two government officials said.Prime Minister Modi is set to convey India’s approach to lifting the lockdown and possibly announcing a rescue package^ a third person familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. Economists and business leaders are pitching for a massive ₹10 trillion fiscal stimulus to support people who have lost their livelihoods and businesses on the verge of collapse.Barring sectors such as aviation and railways^ a possible decision to gradually lift the lockdown will hinge on the capacity and preparedness of state^ district and municipal authorities to contain the spread of the virus^ one of the two government officials said on condition of anonymity. “The lifting of the lockdown has to be in a nuanced way^" said the official. Most officials Mint spoke to agreed that the lockdown is unlikely to continue in its present form after 14 April.View Full Image Here's what we are staring atAccording to policy analyst and political commentator Sanjaya Baru^ the idea of lifting the lockdown in a phased manner marking geographic areas into red^ yellow and green zones depending on the pandemic’s incidence^ is important as continuing with a full-fledged lockdown in the entire country may not be very feasible. “Some kind of opening up in areas where the pandemic’s incidence has not been much should be considered. Along with that^ ensuring access to testing for infections is also very crucial^" said Baru.Rajiv Kumar^ vice chairman of federal policy think tank NITI Aayog^ said in an interview published on Monday that the easing of restrictions on movement has to focus on sectors such as exports and essential commodities more broadly defined to include FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods)^ where demand has not been derailed by the crisis. Employment generating sectors such as real estate and infrastructure that have a multiplier effect in the economy is also a priority area to be allowed to function^ with adequate safeguards^ Kumar had said.India should have a calibrated opening up of the economy^ said Rajat Kathuria^ director and chief executive of Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (Icrier). The country should also ensure that not a single needy person goes hungry and get the weaknesses in the healthcare and social security architecture fixed^ he said. “A calibrated opening up of the economy is something we should look at very seriously^ using as much technology as possible. The best way is to look at geographic areas as red^ amber and green in terms of the pandemic’s impact. There is no point in opening up everything in one go and squander the gains that we have made in controlling the pandemic^" said Kathuria.Maharashtra has extended the lockdown till 30 April but chief minister Uddhav Thackeray assured that there will be relaxations in some areas and tighter enforcement of the lockdown in some other areas. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan too was cited as saying that the next phase of the lockdown will be different from the first one ending on 14 April.The industry department has asked the home ministry to allow certain industries to operate with reasonable safeguards^ even if the government decides to extend the nationwide lockdown.The department suggested that under strict safeguards^ big textile^ automobile and electronics units could be allowed to work up to 25% capacity and exporters with orders in hand could be allowed to work with minimal workforce^ Mint reported on Monday.Electrical^ telecom^ defence^ gem and jewellery units^ special economic and export-oriented units may also get the relief if the proposal is accepted.Industry body Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assocham) said on Monday that it has approached the government for an “immediate and an impactful stimulus package without getting weighed in by any possible downgrade by global rating agencies." The Assocham statement^ citing its president Niranjan Hiranandani^ said that considering the pain of the crisis will be felt more in coming weeks and months^ it was imperative “for the government and RBI to immediately announce a major package for saving the industry^ trade and millions of jobs."Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

2020-04-13,https://www.livemint.com//news/india/the-business-plan-for-life-after-lockdown-11586791916823.html,LiveMint,The business plan for life after lockdown,NEW DELHI : A few days after covid-19 broke out^ the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) sent its 830 members a health advisory. Weeks later^ ACMA is back to the drawing board^ chalking up more guidelines to help auto component makers deal with a post-lockdown world.The scale of the covid-19 infection has ballooned multifold in the past two weeks with India registering over 9^000 cases and 300 deaths. Segregating the working stations on the shop floor is now a must^ so is fumigating the plant every few hours. The number of workers seated in a bus— those that ferry them from the villages to factories—must be capped. Managing the shifts^ the lunch hours and even the sort of cutlery that can be used in the canteens now need a rethink.“One of the interventions we are working on is how a single person can manage multiple machines^" Vinnie Mehta^ director general of ACMA said. “Going forward^ the industry would need systems that enable remote monitoring of processes and machines. You will have more automated vehicles moving inside the plants."Indian manufacturers were coy when it came to adopting automation. A balance between deploying people and machines was in vogue^ partly because of the high capital costs of automation and mostly because cheap manpower is abundant. Covid-19 is challenging many of these assumptions. People deployment on the shop floor has to be significantly cut.The stakes couldn’t be higher. Even if one worker is found to be infected^ an entire factory can be sealed. Component makers supply to many large car^ bike and tractor manufacturers. Production for much of the industry^ therefore^ can come to a standstill^ overnight. Securing the factories and the people who work there are important pillars in the business continuity plan of every company.The big planNearly all companies are in the middle of what they describe as “scenario planning". More automation is on the cards but that’s a long-term goal. This writer spoke to 10 organizations^ from heavy engineering and white goods makers to fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and real estate firms. Besides drawing up social distancing norms^ companies are right now focussed on fixing the supply-side. They are strategizing around securing raw materials^ managing costs^ up-skilling their workforce^ and getting back workers who may have migrated back to their villages.Depending on the sector^ the companies said that demand could take anywhere between a quarter or more to revive.“For each of our factories^ the workers are not just locals. They come from different states^" Sridhar V.^ group vice president and director of Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt Ltd said. “We are planning for different scenarios. By the time people who have gone back to their villages return^ it would take 15-20 days. Many of them are skilled and cannot be replaced easily^" he added.The problem of getting back workers could be worse for sectors such as construction^ which are heavily dependent on casual labour^ Siddharth Jain^ partner at management consulting firm Kearney predicted. Fixing the supply-chain^ particularly for non-essential goods^ wouldn’t be easy either. Part of the packaging material for FMCG companies^ for instance^ are imported. Moreover^ there is also a shortage of components such as pumps used in beauty products since much of the capacity was diverted to the manufacture of hand sanitizers and hand washes.“If there is import dependence^ it is a big task right now to get the supplies. In cases where the supplies are domestic^ companies would need to micromanage their smaller suppliers. A financial health check on the suppliers may be required^" Jain added.People firstMeanwhile^ some industrialists have made a case for a more humane approach in dealing with suppliers and employees. M.S. Unnikrishnan^ managing director and CEO of engineering company Thermax is one of them. “People first^ economy second—this is what I believe in^" he told Mint when asked about the economic consequences of under-utilized factories^ post the lockdown. “We can start with 30% capacity^ go 40-50% over the next few months^" he said.Part of the reason why companies cannot bounce back quickly enough is that suppliers—like Jain indicated—may not be in a good shape. Some of the components for Thermax’s heating^ cooling^ water and waste management products^ for instance^ are made by smaller companies. “The micro^ small and medium enterprises were facing major difficulties even before the lockdown because of economic difficulties. Covid-19 is a double whammy^" Unnikrishnan said.Thermax is^ therefore^ planning to reimburse salaries for the workmen of some of its contractors who are unable to pay given the lockdown. “Currently^ we can’t be contractual and business-like. There should be large heartedness among the larger companies. We may have to make advance payments to some of our smaller suppliers and help them overcome difficulties^" he said.A humane approach in tough times can go a long way in securing trust as well as people^ particularly in the unorganized segments of the economy. Trucking is an example. To get manufacturers on their feet^ India needs drivers to move raw materials and goods. Nevertheless^ drivers were one of the most impacted. Thousands were left high and dry along the highways after the lockdown took effect.“We have around 4^000 vehicles that are stranded in different parts of India carrying loads for customers. These are trucks carrying engines^ cell phones^ televisions etc^" Rampraveen Swaminathan^ managing director and CEO of Mahindra Logistics^ a third-party logistics company^ said. “In many cases^ the drivers have left the vehicles and gone back home out of fear. We are in touch to mobilize them back^" he added.A week into the lockdown^ Mahindra Logistics launched a helpline for the drivers. “In more than 40 sites across India^ we have organized food and temporary lodging. We have also created economic relief programmes for the families of drivers. The intent is to secure assets^ secure drivers^ secure partnerships^" Swaminathan said. Most third-party logistics companies are asset-lite—they don’t own the trucks or employ the drivers directly. Instead^ they depend on big and small transporters who own trucks.Not just drivers^ getting any migrant labour back to the workplace would now require “compassion^ care and comfort"^ industry body Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) contended. Most of them had a harrowing experience finding their way back to the villages.“CII has already begun dialogues with some unions to address their issues^" the industry body wrote in a strategy paper^ Exit From The Lockdown. “Set up accommodation^ with access to food and medical facilities for migrant workers. The next two-three weeks should be used to structure this intervention^" the paper noted.Distancing goalsAn executive from an electronics hardware manufacturer^ which employs over 20^000 people in India^ summed up the post covid-19 scenario^ poignantly. “We have an economic storm^ a health storm^ a security storm. All of them have converged into the perfect storm".The management in the company have taken a 30% salary cut and no workers have been fired just as yet. But then^ he quickly warned^ the electronics hardware industry operates at 5.5-6% margins. “You can sustain these challenges for two-three months. Post that^ retaining the workers or letting them not go may not be an option for me^" the executive who didn’t want to be identified^ said.His immediate challenge^ post the lockdown^ is to have less people on the factory floor in compliance with the social distancing norms. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine^ staying at least six feet away from one another reduces the chances of catching covid-19. This implies factory-floor modifications with lifting and shifting of machinery. It is easier said than done when the lockdown is still in force.“In the short term^ you simply need to have fewer people because one needs time to retrofit a factory—a team of workers is needed for the modifications^" the executive said. Typically^ a worker stands almost shoulder to shoulder in an assembly line. The gap of nearly two metres implies that the manufacturer’s plant would now run at about 30% capacity. “You cannot run the factory with less than 30% capacity anyways^" the executive said. That’s the capacity required to maintain bare minimum profitability.The social distancing norms would shoot up costs. Manufacturers across India would require more number of buses to transport workers^ for instance. In the case of the electronics manufacturer mentioned here^ one seat in the bus sat four workers. Now^ it can seat just one. “I have 30 buses for one of our plants. One worker per seat means I have to run over 100 buses for the same plant^" the executive said.Companies are similarly planning for distancing norms in warehouses and offices. Mahindra Logistics had cut down the density of people in its warehousing floors mid-February. That could continue post the lockdown. Thermax reduced the number of employees in its offices by one-third before the lockdown. It created two shifts instead of the usual one. The first shifts began early^ at 7am and ran till 2-2.30pm. The office was sanitized before the second batch of employees arrived^ at around 2.30-3pm. That’s a strategy likely to continue^ once things start rolling.Getting retail readyThe Zoom conversation with Pushpa Bector^ executive director of DLF Shopping Malls^ began around life in a lockdown. Is this writer getting fish in CR Park (in Delhi)? Well^ yes^ you might if you are resourceful enough. And is she getting vegetables online? No^ not at all. India needs physical retail^ still.Shopping malls^ nonetheless^ may take a bit of time to limp back to normalcy. People may be scared of public spaces. Bector’s scenario planning is around making her retail spaces comfortable for shoppers. “We are evaluating sanitation tunnels at the entrance of the malls. We are assessing the vendors as we speak^" she said.Besides^ there would be social distancing norms in stores^ restaurants and film theatres. The waiting lines would be defined. “I am talking to cinema operators. There should be a two-seat gap between two bookings^" she added. “I am starting to talk to the brands on sanitization of their stores and products. Kitchen sanitization will play an important role in restaurants." Over the next two weeks^ the mall staff would be online trained to be sensitive — understand the customer’s body language to figure out if they are uncomfortable.Brands such as Panasonic^ a home appliance maker^ is also using the lockdown period to ready its retail sales staff and up-skill them.As Panasonic waits for consumer demand for its appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators to return post the lockdown^ the firm is working on a long-term strategy—diversify into the business-to-business (B2B) segment. “Today^ we are more of a B2C (business-to-consumer) company in India—69% of our revenues. We want to rapidly accelerate our B2B capabilities^" Manish Sharma^ president and CEO of Panasonic India and South Asia^ said. Panasonic^ for instance^ makes industrial robots for the automotive sector. Pressing the accelerator on such products would feed into the growing automation story in India’s factories.In the post-covid world^ many more companies would need to re-look at their product strategy. Perhaps^ drop non-essentials. Perhaps^ drop luxury products that may no longer find currency in a climate of tight discretionary spending.“The whole planning process is going to change. Today^ most companies do quarterly and monthly planning of demand^ what needs to be manufactured. People would need to do daily and weekly planning^ reassess the situation every week or so^" Siddharth Jain of Kearney said. “Large companies have a lot of complexity—a lot of products and services. They would need to focus on fewer products because dealing with complexity in a plant would no longer be easy^" he concluded.Some of the more progressive companies have indeed pressed the reset button.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

Marico Ltd’s and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd’s (GCPL’s) Q4 FY20 updates show that the lockdown has made things worse. The updates also point to a stark difference in the performance of the two companies^ which is likely to do with their different product portfolios.Of the two firms^ GCPL’s commentary is far weaker than expectations. The company said domestic business revenue in Q4 FY20 would report a decline of high teens. Analysts had anticipated the decline in domestic revenue to be in the mid-single-digit territory.View Full Image Lower trajectory.Marico^ on the other hand^ said its India business posted low single-digit volume fall in Q4. Its overall performance was boosted by a surge in sales of its edible oils portfolio^ which accounts for 18% of domestic revenue.“For GCPL^ March is a key month for placement given the onset of season for soaps and household insecticides^" said Nitin Gupta^ analyst at SBICAP Securities Ltd. As such^ the disruption in trade last month meant that its performance was hit more than Marico’s.“Marico has an all-season offering and after a price cut in the Parachute portfolio^ there was surge in trade inventory. Besides^ Marico’s food offerings including edible oil have seen strong surge in demand in the wake of the national lockdown^" added Gupta.Further^ with salons shut down^ GCPL’s hair colours portfolio has also been adversely hit.The saving grace for GCPL was that the international business is expected to record around mid-single-digit sales decline in rupee terms for Q4 FY20.Note^ in Q3^ Marico’s India volume had declined by 1%. As such^ the impact of the lockdown doesn’t seem very high. But again^ this may be because of a one-off surge in trade inventory and the stocking up of edible oils.Marico added that the decline in revenue^ coupled with an unfavourable mix in the India business^ will translate into a modest decline in earnings before interest^ tax^ depreciation and amortization in Q4 FY20 on a year-on-year basis.Going ahead^ easing of supply-chain issues owing to the lockdown and demand recovery remain crucial for the FMCG sector as a whole. To be sure^ demand for discretionary products may take longer to revive.Meanwhile^ shares of both Marico and GCPL have recovered well by 27-40% from their 52-week trading lows seen on 23 March on the National Stock Exchange. However^ year to date^ these stocks are still trading about 13% lower.According to Bloomberg^ Marico and GCPL stocks trade at 33 and 34 times their respective earnings estimates for FY21^ more than double the 15 times valuation of the broader market.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share ViaClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

However^ with the adherence to social distancing norms and the eventual lockdown in many geographies of our operations resulted in virtually no sales in the later part of March^ significantly impacting our sales performance in the quarter^" GCPL said in a filing to the stock exchanges on 8 April.Supplies of its brands also weakened at the distributor level. “We did see low double digit sales decline in the performance of our distributors^ implying that their stock levels are getting depleted^" it said.GCPL’s overall India revenue is likely to see 17% sales decline in Q4FY20^ with a volume decline of 11%^ said Nitin Gupta^ analyst^ FMCG at SBI Caps.After the lockdown began on 25 March^ several large FMCG companies selling goods of daily use shuttered or scaled down operations at their manufacturing plants and warehouses. While capacities have gradually improved^ companies are still running at sub-optimum production levels. Moreover^ restricted vehicle movement has prevented supplies from reaching distributors and retailers.Marico Ltd^ which makes Saffola oats and cooking oils^ said that overall^ the India business posted a low single-digit volume decline in the March quarter. However^ its portfolio of Saffola saw “very skewed high growth" as demand for such items rose during lockdown^ the company said in its fourth quarter update earlier this week.Marico^ however^ was able to register sales largely in its edible oils and foods portfolio.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

This followed an RAI survey^ which showed that 20-25% of industry players may need a capital infusion to stay afloat and about 25% jobs in the industry may get impacted.Only 7-8% of the retail industry is functioning at the moment^ as the retailers are selling only essential items^ said Kumar Rajagopalan^ CEO^ RAI^ which represents 13^667 member establishments with 500^000 stores employing 43 million people.The situation will be bleak even after the lockdown is lifted^ said Pinakiranjan Mishra^ lead^ consumer products and retail^ Ernst & Young. “For a long time after the lockdown is lifted^ the consumers will be in a reactive mode and will buy only what is needed. After that^ we will have a recovery mode^" Mishra added.However^ its the job losses that are worrying the industry the most. “It looks like 20-25% of jobs could be a question mark. All of them are expecting some kind of support from the government^" said Rajagopalan.The industry has more than 15 million retailers^ including big and small^ traditional and modern trade. Retail employs 40-50 million Indians directly.Anuj Puri^ chairman^ Anarock^ advised the top leadership of companies to take a pay cut. “I genuinely believe that this time it is productivity loss and not capital erosion. Don’t lose talent."Last week^ the retail industry had sought state support besides special support from the Reserve Bank of India.The industry called for extending the moratorium to 270 days for payment of instalments and interest of term loans^ short-term loans^ corporate loans^ securitized loans^ and bonds^ from 15 March to 31 December. However^ a key theme that emerged was not losing focus on communication^ which is the key to survival in current times.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

GCPL is awaiting the government’s approval to resume factory operations^ albeit with 50% of its manufacturing and distribution workforce to ensure availability of essential goods and minimize the impact of the lockdown^ both for the consumer and the company.In an exclusive interview with Mint^ Vivek Gambhir^ Managing Director and CEO of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. said the lockdown has significantly impacted the FMCG sector and the covid-19 crisis may ultimately lead to an emergence of new FMCG products^ a change in consumer behaviour and a shift in the market’s focus to health protection and hygiene. In order to get the business back on track^ GCPL said the company will need to make certain commitments to the government. Edited excerpts:Due to the Covid-19 crisis and the lockdown how badly is the FMCG sector impacted and what is the new strategy adopted by Godrej to maintain the growth momentum at this stage?Like all the other sectors^ the consumer goods industry will also be significantly impacted simply because the markets have been shut down over the last 10 days or so. There has been no distribution in the market and consequently productions have also been shut down. The extent of the impact will depend on how long this crisis persists. Within categories^ the discretionary ones could get more impacted than staples in the near term. And we will also see new habits and changes in consumer behaviour. As a strategy^ going forward^ our first priority is to get the supply chain back on track^ get production back and running and ensure availability of essential items. The focus is to resume production activities of essential items. Our first priority is to keep our team members healthy and safe. At this stage^ availability takes precedence over pricing. In recent days^ the supply chain has been disrupted. This is not a surprise^ considering the unprecedent nature of the lockdown across the country. The government is well aware of the challenges and in line with its commitment to ensure uninterrupted supplies of essential items^ it is working closely with the industry to get the supply chain back on track. So^ after a shutdown of a few days^ we are ramping up our manufacturing and distribution again. This will be at a reduced capacity.What is Godrej doing to get the production activity back on track?Basically^ we are working with the government to be able to get the necessary permissions required to start up some of our factories and get the permission to resume distribution. The permissions have been mostly coming into place over the past 2-3 days. The ministry of home affairs has revised guidelines to ensure production and distribution of essential items. All our team members working on the front line^ in our factories^ with our distributors and with our transporters are Covid Warriors^ who are doing this in national interest and are serving our country by producing essential items. In line with government guidelines^ we are committed to dramatically reducing the number of people involved in our manufacturing^ warehousing and distribution by 50%. The biggest challenge is to be able get adequate laborers to be able to come and work in the factories. We are working with the government there also to try and see what measures we can take to allow movement of workers. We are also working with our transporters to change the practice of two drivers per truck to one driver per truck^ thereby reducing 50% of truckers. For those workers who need to travel^ we are arranging private vehicles or company provided transport with not more than 50% capacity utilisation per vehicle.Hopefully^ over the next few days we will see a higher movement of workers while respecting all the necessary lockdown norms. That’s the primary focus to tide over the current crisis. Secondly^ depending on how long it takes the crisis to return back to normal^ we are preparing some recovery plans in terms of what new product categories might emerge from this. I think there will be a greater focus on health protection and hygiene and we are putting in efforts to make a stronger presence in those categories. We also see a greater amount of push on online sales; so^ we are looking at our online strategy to see if we can accelerate that in a few areas. Overall^ as a result of this crisis^ there could be some shifts in for the larger organised players... we are already seeing some shift in “do-it-yourself" kind of products^ etc. So^ the strategy to tide over the crisis is to ensure a ready availability of products and then^ as the situation improves^ to figure out our bounce-back plan.How accommodative is the government with regards to preventing supply chain disruption?The government has clarified in the revised guidelines about the transportation of essential items and about the definition of essential and non-essential items. The government is extremely responsive and accommodative. It is clear that the steps being taken are to resume operations; for example^ the government is also open to considering giving “passes" to top 50 companies to responsibly manage and run their end-to-end supply chain operations^ unimpeded by local authorities. This will be very helpful if implemented. There will be some commitments that we too have to make to in terms of only having half-the-number of manufacturing people^ we can request for changing shift from 8 hours to 12 hours and having half the number of distributors in the market etc. Along with this^ if the government can acknowledge that all the frontline workers who are ensuring that essential items are available^ are doing so in national interest^ it will help remove fear from their minds and enable them to report to their work locations with higher responsibility.Can you quantify in terms of laborers^ what is the impact on the workforce engaged in your manufacturing activities^ what percentage of staff are now working and secondly in terms of pricing of products is there any change? Also^ if the lockdown continues what kind of impact it may have on companies like Godrej Consumer Products? How will you ensure that there is no hit on revenues?All our office space staff are working from home. Within factories currently about 20-30% of our workforce are working in our factories. Distributors are in very small numbers right now. The hope is that over time as supply chain ramps up^ we will get about 50% workforce in factories and 50% capacity in the distribution network. That way if we are able to get 50% there in terms of key workforce we will be able to get adequate supply. Like the rest of the industry^ we have seen a significant impact on sales from the lockdown. This is clearly a crisis situation for the country and our focus right now is on the safety of our employees and ensuring ready availability of essential items. In terms of impact estimate^ we don’t have an answer right now because it will all depend on how long the crisis continues. I don’t have numbers from India but what I can tell you is that if we look at the reports from China^ if that is an indication^ the data for January and February^ assuming a two-month lockdown^ showed retail sales went down by 21%^ out of which the apparel industry went down by 31%^ cosmetics went down by about 15%^ personal care and home care went down by about 7% (this had less impact because of higher sales of soaps and sanitizers). The range is between minus 5% to minus 30%. With regards to pricing^ our entire objective right now is to ensure product availability. In fact^ in sanitizers we have reduced the price from Rs. 75 to Rs. 25 in line with the government guidelines. We had a plan a couple of months ago to increase soap prices because raw material prices had gone up significantly. But we held on to the pricing. So^ given the situation the country is going through^ I think there will be no pricing action right now. We are prepared to take a hit on profitability. We have a healthy financial position and hence we have the ability to tide over the crisis as the need of the hour is product availability.What is that one thing that you feel the government should do improve the situation?In the near term^ the biggest challenge for the government will be to ensure translation of the guidelines with consistency and uniformity to ensure enforcement of the guidelines at the local level. If the processes are streamlined^ it will help things move faster. The need of the hour is to act quickly to ensure adequate supply and that’s how the government can help the FMCG sector.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via

However^ the availability of raw material and packaging material remains a challenge due to the restricted movement of trucks.The vehicles used by the company for transporting raw material and packaging material for hygiene products^ such as hand sanitizers^ are stuck at state borders. “A lot of time is being spent on sorting out administrative issues at the state level^" Khan said.The Centre’s guidelines should be properly communicated to authorities across states and to the local police^ he said. “Proper implementation of these guidelines will ensure seamless movement of raw materials and finished goods across state borders. There is a similar issue being faced at ports^ which is hurting the smooth movement of imported raw materials and exporting of finished products^" he added.At Nobel Hygiene^ the maker of adult diapers Friends and baby diapers Teddyy^ the problem is twofold. “There is a problem in getting people to work and ensuring our finished products reach the market. We have a couple of mini buses that carry 35 people each. However^ because of the announcements about social distancing^ only 8-10 people can travel in each vehicle^" said Kartik Johari^ vice-president^ Nobel Hygiene. “We are taking pains to educate people on the coronavirus and making them understand that we are in an essential products category."The fear of the disease and migration has affected transport logistics^ he said. “Truck drivers and delivery people who are mostly migrants have either fled or don’t want to take the risk."A Hindustan Unilever spokesperson^ however^ said that several of the companies’ plants^ which manufacture products such as hand sanitizers^ soaps and disinfectants^ are functioning with limited capacity. “As the government has mandated social distancing^ we cannot engage our entire workforce and have instructed our plant managers accordingly^" the person said.HUL has seen an improvement in transportation as its trucks have got stickers from the authorities that allow them to move their products. “We are not facing much of a transportation problem now^" the spokesperson said.A top executive at a large packaged foods firm^ however^ said that “things were pretty bad". “We are not producing at full capacity in our plants because of labour issues. Production is down by 20-40% overall^" he said^ requesting anonymity. “Getting labour to work is a big issue as they prefer the security of their homes."Supplies of essential goods were disrupted across the country as large producers of packaged consumer goods had to suspend production and shutter warehouses because of the lockdown. Companies were not being to able move stock from plants to warehouses for several days. Suppliers and distributors^ too^ were unable to move stock to kirana stores and large grocery stores because of the restrictions.Relief has come in the form of a Sunday order by the home ministry that authorized the transportation of all goods^ without distinguishing them as essential or non-essential. The clarification followed persistent demands from big fast-moving consumer goods companies who make items of daily needs and feared a possible shortage in household goods supplies.Encouraged by the guidelines that now allow movement of non-essential goods^ Capital Foods Pvt Ltd aims to resume operations at two of its plants this week^ said its chief executive officer^ Navin Tewari. The maker of Ching’s Secret brand of noodles and other desi Chinese condiments saw its units shuttered as part of the lockdown.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
2020-03-26,https://www.livemint.com//industry/retail/coronavirus-sanitizers-hand-wash-cooking-oil-shore-up-demand-for-fmcg-goods-11585222642782.html,LiveMint,Coronavirus: Sanitizers^ hand wash^ cooking oil shore up demand for FMCG goods,NEW DELHI: Market researcher Nielsen on Thursday said a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country led to huge surge in demand for hand sanitizers^ masks^ liquid hand washes^ cooking oils^ and pulses^ especially online^ as shoppers stocked up on personal hygiene goods^ as well as basic staples^ fearing an impending lockdown in the country.In a presentation estimating the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Indian fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and retailers^ Nielsen said hygiene categories showed significant growth in February. In March^ Indians swiftly moved to heavy buying of food staples such as packaged flour (atta) and packaged pulses^ and indulgence foods categories like salty snacks.Nielsen surveyed sales of such products across e-commerce retailers^ grocery stores^ and shoppers in the country. Its research tracked shopper behavior and sale of subsequent goods starting February till 21 March.As number of Covid-19 cases have continued to rise in India^ the hand sanitizers category witnessed a whopping 53% growth in February against an 11% increase during November-January.Online sale of such goods was especially high. Average weekly orders of hand sanitizers jumped 1425% online--in the first two weeks of March compared with February--while growth in orders for face masks surged 408% and that of hand washes rose 88%.Floor and toilet cleaners saw a 77% increase in online orders during the period.In traditional trade^ value sales of sanitizers between mid-February to mid-March were up 144% compared with a 72% jump in the year-ago period.Nielsen also tracked purchase behavior of shoppers during March when states started announcing lockdowns. This^ Nielsen said^ showed “pantry preparation and quarantined living stages."“This included heavy buying of staple food categories such as packaged wheat flour (Aatta) and packaged pulses. Likewise we saw significant growth in indulgence foods categories as well^" Nielsen said.In traditional trade^ value sales of branded pulses grew 72% year-on-year during mid-Feb to mid-March. While^ packaged flour saw a 25% year-on-year jump in sales (in value terms).Online too^ these categories saw a big surge in orders. Average weekly order growth for cooking oil surged 106% during mid-February to mid-March^ while that of cooking essentials such as spices^ salt^ ghee was up 21%^ wheat flour orders were up 16%. Online^ sale of salty snacks rose 84%^ while soft drinks saw a 68% jump in average weekly orders between February and March.Now^ as India has entered the 21-day lockdown^ consumers told Nielsen they are highly likely to stock up on personal hygiene products such as hand wash^ soaps^ and sanitizers^ with 91% respondents agreeing to buying these. About 74% of agreed to buy cleaning products^ while 67% said they will stock up on grocery essentials such as atta^ rice^ lentils^ oils^ followed by other who said fruits and vegetables would be key.India’s FMCG industry grew 6% year-on-year in November^ and 5% in December^ and January^ but a spike in sales of personal hygiene products and basic staples pushed the value growth for fast moving consumer goods to 8% in February.The country's large fast moving consumer market had reported sluggish sales over the last 12-18 months^ especially as rural markets slowed down. In January^ Nielsen maintained its annual growth outlook for India’s FMCG sector to 9-10% for 2020. In 2019^ the sector grew 9.7% by value^ due to weak quarterly growth rates in rural India.But Covid-19 is likely to see these estimates alter depending on future demand.“Given Covid-19 we will have to revise our estimates on the sector and given that it is a once-in-a century situation^ it is very difficult to call where growth will pan out^" Prasun Basu^ president^ South Asia for Nielsen^ said in a call with journalists on Thursday.Basu said it is unlikely that things will come to a standstill^ "Consumption is still ongoing…you will find high points and low sales points^ and de-growth in some categories in the month of April^" he added.Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.Share Via
