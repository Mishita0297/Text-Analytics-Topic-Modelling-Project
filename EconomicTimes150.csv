Now^ that tech support guy who the chairman won’t recognise may have an inside line on the board’s critical calls – thanks to all director meetings happening over video conferencing.Office IT departments have access to content of video meetings run on company infrastructure. And companies are waking up to this^ asking their IT employees to comply with insider trading prevention rules A leading paint company recently asked 35 employees from its IT team to disclose market investments made by them and their immediate family members.“Our compliance team indicated that IT department employees who have access to sensitive information need to be treated as designated persons under insider trading rules^” said an official of the company. “It’s not just price sensitive information^ during our internal meetings we also tend to discuss our vendors^ suppliers^ which themselves are listed companies.”Earlier^ in most companies^ only a few IT employees who took care of top company officials’ computers were in the designated persons list.A Maharashtra-based fast moving consumer goods company has sent a precautionary email to its IT team^ warning them not to discuss anything they have heard in board meetings with outsiders.“This is something new for both the management and the IT department employees. So^ we are trying to create an awareness in the department about dos and don’ts while possessing price sensitive information^” said a board member of the company.As per Securities and Exchange Board of India’s insider trading rules^ every company needs to maintain a database of its employees and third-party vendors who may be in possession of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI).People included in the list are called designated persons and they are subject to several compliance requirements.To begin with^ they are not allowed to buy or sell the company’s stock while in possession of any insider information. Also^ they are required to make disclosures on their investments.Legal experts say insider trading rules apply not just to these employees but even to their immediate relatives and to anyone such an employee has significant financial dealings with. “Listed companies will have to revisit their definition of designated persons considering the fact that new set of people including employees from IT department may now have access to UPSI^” said Tomu Francis^ partner^ Khaitan & Co.

The country's most valuable retailer by market capitalisation^ however^ widened its net loss by 57% to Rs80 crore in the four-year old e-commerce subsidiary - Avenue E-Commerce.A year ago^ its online business - DMart Ready - posted sales of Rs 144 crore with net loss of Rs 51 crore^ according to the company's latest annual report. Unlike grocery delivery startups like Amazon^ Grofers and BigBasket^ which rely on delivery-based distribution model^ DMart's online venture essentially has multiple delivery centres or pick-up points in catchment areas^ where it has a store^ so that customers can order online and pick up products from there.D'Mart that operates over 214 stores said the current pandemic could significantly alter the new store roll out strategy for the industry that witnessed extended store closures^ lower footfalls and lean demand.""E-Commerce has always been a focus area in the industry. The COVID-19 situation has further amplified the growing importance of this channel. Online grocery is still a relatively under-penetrated segment within e-retail^ but has gained significant attention in the last few months as consumers have rapidly adopted online ordering of household grocery and other items^"" the company said in its annual report.Within the physical retail channel^ DMart has better operational metrics such as cost to sales or invested capital than Aldi and Lidl^ the German retailers that are often seen as benchmarks for discount retailing as they run some of the leanest retail operations globally. In fact^ DMart stores generated revenue per square foot of Rs32^879^ nearly three times compared to other grocery rivals in India.According to a recent Nielsen report^ e-Commerce that has been witnessing the fastest growth at 16% during the quarter ended June^ but faced challenges of supply chain and last mile delivery due to government regulations and movement restrictions in April that impacted last-mile deliveries badly. While online channels account for 3% of total fast moving consumer goods sales^ its contribution is over 9% in metros^ said Nielsen."

The industry fears these closures may further delay the recovery of the market.Parle Products said almost 10% of the 5.8 million kirana stores that used to sell tea and paan^ operating from homes and roadside corners^ shut down in April and May. Parle category head B Krishna Rao said distributors have lost money from these outlets whose owners barely break even. “Most of these outlets may have shut down permanently. Even 1-2% of the bigger 42 lakh kiranas have shut down^ with owners having gone back to villages and this may remain so for the next 5-6 months. While some of these may reopen^ still the closure of small kiranas will affect the reach of companies^” said Rao.Britannia Industries managing director Varun Berry said a large part of store closures may be temporary and they may come back progressively as the lockdown eases^ although there might be some long-term reduction of kiranas.Sunil Kataria^ Godrej Consumer Products CEO-India & SAARC^ also expects store closures to be a temporary phenomenon^ even though the duration is uncertain.“Reopening of these shops would be dependent on factors like controlling the Covid-19 outbreak in cities^ which will provide a sense of safety and availability of labour to run these shops^” he said.India has about 10-12 million small retail outlets selling grocery and other fast-moving consumer goods but a large number of them are fragmented and located in the hinterland. In the smartphone market^ AIMRA president Arvinder Khurana said several store owners have been hit by liquidity issues^ extremely low supplies from brands in the sub-₹15^000 segment^ absence of consumer finance and very few footfalls. “Amid these challenges^ operational costs have more than doubled^ which can lead to permanent closure of several thousand stores.”As per Nielsen^ there was a 34% YoY drop in FMCG industry sales in April^ led by a 38% fall in sales in smaller stores^ even as modern trade recorded growth of 5%.Viren Shah^ president of Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association ^ which represents over 3.5 lakh shops in Maharashtra^ said that while shopkeepers can’t use local transport^ most kirana shops are burdened with rent. “As a result^ they would rather shut shop than face issues including fixed costs^ delivery hassles and migration of staff^” Shah said.

PE/VC investors have been riding a decade-long growth wave in transaction volumes^ valuations and fundraising^ however the current crisis has eroded some of the value of investments and dampened investor confidence.Consumer goods^ household and consumer products as well as FMCG companies should see favour amongst PE/VC investors as high returns often emerge in times like these and can offset the losses during the downturn. There is also a massive amount of dry powder readily available at the investors’ disposal and CPG companies stand to benefit as Covid-19 has materially changed the outlook towards consumer goods essentials as a sector.According to VCCEdge ^ a notable deal activity in the FMCG sector was seen as Avenue Supermarts Ltd. (D-Mart) raised $4.86 million in February 2020 and Ador Multiproducts Ltd. raised $0.29 million in July 2020. The sector also saw another big ticket deal happening as Hindustan Unilever Ltd. acquired the Horlicks Brand for India for $415.3 million in April 2020. For the household and consumer products sector^ the average deal value recorded in 2020 was $5.07 million as compared to $7.15 million in 2019^ a drop of 29%. Honasa Consumer Pvt. Ltd. (Mamaearth) raised $18.22 million thus accounting for another notable deal in the sector in 2020.Ruby Dobriyal^ Manager - Research^ VCCEdge^ said in a statement^ “There has been deferment in the deals activity in 2020 as investors are waiting to see the extent of the damage that has been caused due to the pandemic^ however there has been a lot of change in the preference amongst consumers. For the household and consumer products there has been an average of 2.3X increase of income among the online delivery platforms such as Milkbasket^ Big Basket^ Swiggy and Zomato."""" Companies such as Milkbasket rode on the sentiments of consumers and innovated their supply chain and business models where they were allowing people to place orders up to 10 PM with guaranteed delivery the next morning between 7-8 AM. This allowed for an increase in the total income for the platform by 2.8X. These numbers may certainly impress PE/VC investors looking at the sector as going forward customers are likely to prefer the online model over traditional models for convenience^ social distancing & health above all else^” she added.The funding activity is expected to be hit and not recover in comparison to the earlier years for the latter part of 2020 due to unprecedented impact on economic activity caused by lockdowns and social distancing. VCCEdge reported a drop of 50% in terms of volume (2 deals in Q3 2020 as compared to 4 deals in Q3 2019) and 82% in terms of value ($5.15 Mn in Q3 2020 as compared to $28 Mn in Q3 2019) in the consumer goods sector. This drop is on account of the pandemic but once the market starts recovering it might unearth golden opportunities in the future for sectors such as consumer goods due to changing consumer preferences.Shalil Gupta^ Chief Business Officer^ Mosaic Digital^ said in a statement^ “The crisis caused by COVID-19 has changed the composition of consumption basket for consumers. There is an increased focus on food and essential products with the demands increasing two to three fold in the last four to five months. The pandemic has also forced consumers who were apprehensive earlier to shop online hence making online shopping a new normal.”"

This marks consolidation of the US major’s entire retail portfolio in the country.The deal announced on Thursday clears the decks for Flipkart to expand its business-to-business vertical and take the fight to Amazon and Reliance JioMart in wooing legions of small retailers.Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart — acquired by Walmart for $16 billion in 2018 — will launch its wholesale unit next month^ with categories such as fashion and grocery. This will pit it against a slew of rivals^ from JioMart and Amazon B2B to business commerce enabler Udaan and German retail giant Metro Cash & Carry.“With the launch of Flipkart Wholesale ^ we will now extend our capabilities across technology^ logistics and finance to small businesses. The acquisition of Walmart India will strengthen our position to address the needs of kiranas and MSMEs uniquely^” said Kalyan Krishnamurthy^ chief executive^ Flipkart group.The company declined to share financial details of the deal^ only saying that Walmart India employees will move to Flipkart group.ET reported in its January 13 edition that Walmart had let go of nearly 100 senior executives — including vice-presidents — across sourcing^ agri-business and the fast-moving consumer goods divisions. The report said the downsizing was a precursor to a sale or consolidation of the unit with Flipkart.Analysts are of the view that consolidating retail units will boost Flipkart’s ambitions in grocery retailing. “This is in line with Flipkart’s plan to be aggressive in grocery^ and use customers and assets created by Walmart to prepare for the battle with Jio and Amazon^” said Satish Meena of Forrester Research.Walmart India chief executive Sameer Aggarwal told ET the combination “allows us to grow much faster and become bigger.” The Best Price operation will continue to run as it is^ he said^ while clarifying that “in terms of legal structure^ Walmart India is currently a separate entity within the Flipkart group.”Walmart has long been scouting for a viable and competitive business model for the Best Price brand^ which consists of 28 stores and ecommerce operations.Accumulated losses for Walmart India stood at ₹2^181 crore until March 2019. In fiscal 2019^ the company reported revenue of ₹4^095 crore on a loss of ₹172 crore. In contrast^ Metro AG posted 10% growth in net sales^ to ₹6^755 crore^ during the year ended September 2019^ according to its global annual report^ which also said the Indian unit has been profitable for the past two years.Aggarwal will remain with the company during the transition and will then move to a different role within Walmart. Adarsh Menon^ senior vice president at Flipkart^ who leads the B2B initiative said Flipkart Wholesale “will draw on the merchandising experience of Walmart India^ strong relationship with brands^ and the 12-plus years of operating Best Price.”With Covid-19 accelerating the willingness of small businesses to adopt technology for expansion^ a new market has opened up for ecommerce players. According to a report by Redseer Consulting^ three of four mom-and-pop stores have no exposure to technology platforms for any service^ including payments or procurement. Forrester’s Meena said^ “Given the structure of our market^ small merchants and kirana shops remain the top priority for (ecommerce) players.”For full report go to www.economictimes.com

According to a Nielsen report^ this has now increased even as local grocer's share fell 220 basis points^ entirely taken by ecommerce and modern retailers.India’s largest smartphone maker^ Xiaomi India MD Manu Kumar Jain said share of ecommerce to smartphone sales in India at around 40% is one of the highest globally. “It may go up further now^ but in the long-term there will be equilibrium with offline^” he said.Smartphone trackers like IDC too expect that share of ecommerce for smartphones may gain by 5% this year in India. “Initial demand for 1-2 months will come up from ecommerce. But brands cannot ignore offline for long in India and they may undertake more hyperlocal initiatives^” IDC India research director Navkendar Singh said.Realme India CEO Madhav Sheth said ecommerce^ due to its contactless nature^ will become a practice for all handset brands and push all brands to convert to a more online-oriented business. ""We expect offline to pick up eventually^ especially in smaller towns^ where penetration of ecommerce is low^” he said.Apple^ LG and Samsung indicated in their earnings call last week that ecommerce will gain traction now and two industry executives said there is clear cut directives from headquarters of these brands to speed up India initiatives. LG Electronics India head for online business^ Deepak Taneja said going forward consumers in tier two and three towns will also start buying from ecommerce.Apple CEO Tim Cook had last week said there is definitely a move to ecommerce. “Whether that's a permanent shift^ I would hesitate to go that far because I think people like to be out and about. They just know that now is not the time to do that^” he had said on an earnings call. The iPhone maker has asked its 500-odd franchisee-owned exclusive stores in India to push sales through online.Apple and Samsung did not respond to emails ET had sent as of press time Monday."

That’s circumventing traditional trade and distributor networks in areas where last-mile delivery has been disrupted due to Covid-19 restrictions.Their latest direct-to-home initiatives involve partnering startups such as Dunzo^ Scootsy and Swiggy by listing brand stores on their portals and even reaching out to resident welfare associations (RWAs) through their sales staff.While retailers have been doing this for more than a month to implement physical-distancing norms after pantry loading led to increased footfalls^ it is a first for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies.“These partnerships are a vindication of the power of collaboration as no brand alone has answers to fulfil the needs of the nation during these unprecedented times^” said B Sumant^ executive director at ITC Ltd^ which is also selling products through its own portal.As companies grapple with a shortage of staff with migrant workers having left for their homes^ the supply chain has been thrown into disarray across the ecosystem — from sourcing raw materials to manufacturing and delivery of finished products.“We are deploying new strategies and finding innovative solutions to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential products to our consumers^” said Mohit Malhotra^ CEO^ Dabur^ which has tied up with online delivery service providers for retail outlets and households.“Our sales officials are reaching out to RWAs across the country and ensuring availability of our range of immunity boosters^” Malhotra said.FMCG companies have set up storefronts on hyperlocal delivery platforms and are servicing orders from exclusive brand stores and directly from distribution centres^ using delivery partners to get items to the doorstep.Food ordering firm Swiggy has expanded its store network to more than 200 cities^ allowing consumers to order groceries from neighbourhood shops.“Through these partnerships^ we are extending our hyperlocal delivery offering to unlock a new dimension of convenience for our consumers as well as earnings for our delivery partners^” said a Swiggy spokesperson. “Considering the present situation^ our primary focus has been to address customer needs and pain points and their biggest ask has been to enable easy access to groceries and essentials.”Companies aren’t sure whether such initiatives will become established as a regular part of their supply chain^ which has traditionally depended on distributors and retailers while they focus on manufacturing and promoting brands.“We will continue to evaluate and expand such opportunities with our partners to serve our consumers during this difficult time^” said a P&G spokesperson. “In addition^ we continue to make interventions to strengthen our end to end supply chain to serve consumers with our products across different channels.”Hyperlocal partners offer consumer goods makers easier access to customers amid the lockdown.“Dunzo ensures demand density for these brands^ and as long as we are able to maintain that^ brands should continue to leverage the on-demand experience of Dunzo^” said Kartik Mishra^ head of strategy and new initiatives at the startup. “Direct to consumer (D2C) just becomes an additional distribution channel for brands in addition to traditional retail and ecommerce that they already have.”Experts feel single-brand stores on hyperlocal platforms will see low traction as consumers will prefer to get everything they need rather than stick to one label. “While we have cut out retailers from the equation now^ we will have to wait and watch if these partnerships continue post the pandemic^” said an executive at a hyperlocal startup. “If demand drops post the lifting of the lockdown^ neither us nor the brands might want to continue these partnerships.”

We decide on the scale of these engagements basis our business plans. However^ American Express is committed to no Covid-19-related layoffs of our employees for the remainder of 2020^” a company spokesperson added in the emailed response. Teleperformance did not respond to queries seeking comment. Hundreds of thousands of contract staff work in sectors such as those cited above. Often^ they are feet-on-the-street^ selling their clients’ products or performing marketing functions.With physical interactions reduced to a minimum due to the virus outbreak^ many are being sacked.“We are seeing rationalisation happening in almost every business and industry^ be it by way of headcount or wages. This is happening across temporary and permanent employees^” said Rituparna Chakraborty^ cofounder of staffing firm TeamLease Services Ajit Isaac^ chairman of business services provider Quess Corp^ said the company has seen a reduction in its workforce over the last 45 days^ across retail and financial services. “May and June will be severe months^” Isaac said.ET reported last month that Udaan^ a B2B e-commerce startup^ had fired about 10-15% of its contract staff^ affecting at least 3^000 jobs. The same month^ Rupeek^ which operates an online marketplace for gold loans^ terminated a human resource contract with Aasaanjobs^ a recruitment marketplace for blue and grey-collar jobs^ which allegedly indirectly impacted 600 jobs.Food delivery platforms Zomato and Swiggy have also said that they would retrench employees. These are likely to include employees on contract as well. Those who have not been retrenched are seeing salaries being restructured.“About 40% of our 190 clients have restructured the salaries of their outsourced staff^” said Aditya Narayan Mishra^ director of CIEL HR Services.He said clients have done away with or reduced special allowances^ professional development allowances^ conveyance etc. To be sure^ as economic activity reopens and ecommerce firms start delivering items deemed non-essential in non-containment zones^ contract hiring will restart^ especially in deliveries and warehousing^ experts said.“But^ supply overwhelms demand at this point of time^” said Kamal Karanth^ co-founder at Xpheno^ a staffing company.

Crisil analysed over 2^300 non-financial companies from its rated portfolio that availed of the moratorium after categorising them by rating^ sector and size.""Three out of four entities that availed of moratorium are rated in the sub-investment grade. Most of them were grappling with a slowing economy before the pandemic began. The severely curtailed business activity that followed in the first quarter of this fiscal had cramped cash flows^ so the moratorium came as a big relief^"" the rating agency said.In March the Reserve Bank of India had announced a three month moratorium on interest payment by companies as well as individuals to help them deal with the economic collapse due to the Covid 19 induced lockdown. It was further extended in May and end today.However^ as an extraordinary dispensation banks were asked to restructure loans by either giving borrowers more time to pay or reducing interest rates. Banks will start the restructuring exercise from September 1.Crisil said the moratorium provided much-needed liquidity support to mid-sized sub-investment grade (rated BB+ or lower) companies. It has also prevented a sharp weakening of their credit profiles. The higher rated companies did not need to avail the moratorium.Only one out of four companies that availed of the moratorium is rated in the investment grade (rated BBB- or higher). They took recourse to the moratorium to build a liquidity cushion for exigencies in the near term^ Crisil said.""Every fifth company in highly impacted sectors such as gems and jewellery^ hotel^ auto components^ automobile dealers^ power (power utilities^ independent power producers and energy traders)^ packaging^ and capital goods and components availed of the moratorium. On the other hand^ only one in ten did from less-impacted sectors such as pharmaceuticals^ chemicals^ FMCG ^ secondary steel and agriculture. Size has also been a differentiator with few relatively bigger businesses going for it.

Domestic rating agency Icra analysed financial results of 489 companies to arrive at the conclusion.It can be noted that the GDP of the country contracted by 23.9 per cent during the quarter^ which had witnessed total lockdown of the country for the first two months to contain the spread of the coronavirus infections.The rating agency said corporate revenues had been falling for three quarters prior to the last one due to the weak macroeconomic climate but had never declined by as high as the 31.1 per cent for April-June 2020 as compared to the year-ago period.""Restrictions on manufacturing^ industrial^ construction and consumption activities for the major part of Q1 FY2021 due to imposition of nationwide lockdown primarily hurt the financial performance of the Indian corporate sector^"" its vice president Shamsher Dewan said.He said the contraction in revenues was sharpest in consumer-oriented sectors where revenues contracted to nearly half of the year-ago levels^ given customer wariness for large-ticket buys because of the uncertain economic environment and erosion of purchasing power.Sectors like airlines^ hotels^ retail^ automotive^ consumer durables which represent discretionary spending were significantly impacted^ while FMCG and consumer goods were relatively less impacted^ he said.From pre-tax margins perspective^ the number narrowed to 3.6 per cent in Q1 as against 4.3 per cent in the preceding March quarter^ the agency said.""Negligible revenues for the major part of the quarter^ which impacted the absorption of fixed overheads^ and lower realisation in commodity sectors (especially metals and oil and gas)^ weighed on the profitability of India Inc ^ with profit before tax margins contracting to multi-year lows^"" the agency said.Sectors with sharp margin contraction included airlines^ hotels^ retail^ healthcare^ and gems and jewellery^ it said.The agency^ however^ said that margins would revive from these historic lows in the present quarter^ supported by better distribution of fixed overheads vis-a-vis the period of negligible sales.From an interest coverage ratio perspective^ pressure on credit profiles seemed to be building up^ the agency said. It can be noted that the RBI had given a moratorium for six months which ended on August 31 and has allowed loan recasts on a case to case perspective after that."

19 May^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/why-india-needs-to-go-vocal-for-local-stores/articleshow/75812730.cms,Economic Times,Why India needs to go vocal for local stores,With lockdown being eased in various levels in various states comes multiple complexities and issues^ particularly on the operations and supply chain front . In the first three phases of lockdown^ we have experienced these issues.There was a massive disruption in industry at three levels: one^ fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) players struggled to manage production and transportation; two^ retailers and wholesalers were unable to operate freely and fully; three^ e-commerce players couldn’t even handle delivery of essential items.It is heartening to see governments and stakeholders realising the true potential of kirana stores in these unprecedented times. The easing of lockdown in instalments will help localised retailers to operate in a sanitised environment while catering to an uptick in footfalls.This is the age of smart kiranas where standard deliveries and online ordering are on the rise. Kiranas have taken the nimble approach in managing their inventory and neighbourhood customers with express delivery service^ using digital technologies to procure^ sell and service their customers even during lockdown.In the initial phases of lockdown^ there were several expectations of the ecommerce sector being enabled to cater to at least essential goods . Even before this week’s latest easing of lockdown norms allowing non-essential e-deliveries from Monday^ kiranas filled this role. Kirana stores are traditional businesses and they understand the pulse and pain of their customers^ being experts in the trade of food and groceries.Food and grocery deliveries are a different ball game^ and cannot be a model to be implemented overnight. eCommerce has its own strengths that can’t be compared with neighbourhood stores^ which account for the sale of 90% of India’s food and commodity produce. They are not only the backbone of the supply chain management but are also a basic essential part of our economy.There are about 12 million kirana stores in India^ ranging from large stores in cities to tiny village shops servicing a few hundred. A significant number of these stores sell food and groceries^ along with other household supply products.The harsh reality is that during lockdown^ several hurdles were encountered by them. In states such as Uttar Pradesh^ Punjab^ Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat^ kirana owners were not allowed to open their stores or procure essential items. Several owners failed to source fresh fruit and vegetables^ as the local mandis and agricultural produce market committee (APMC) markets were shut down.Panic buying led to faster depleting stocks^ and the stores ran out of branded stock without replenishments^ as the supply chains of FMCG companies were disrupted. This led to ashortage of essential items and crowding at modern retail outlets that contribute only 8% in the overall food and groceries category. At a time when kiranas were largely relying on wholesalers and cash-and carry outlets for their stock renewal^ with restrictions imposed on them^ neighbourhood stores were unable to replenish^ source^ stock and sell essential items to end customers.Today^ as GoI and state governments allow both brick-and-mortar retailers and e-commerce sellers to sell and deliver non-essential items and professional services^ some state governments are holding back. Needless to say^ this graded easing allowing non-essential item sales keeping Covid-19 mitigation guidelines intact will help kiranas^ who have so far only been allowed to sell essential items.This intervention is necessary to open up the economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s May 12 appeal to ‘go vocal for local’ fits like a glove into this scheme of things. State governments should liaise with^ and aid law and order authorities^ to enable the smooth functioning of all stores so that standard operating procedures (SOPs) during these Covid-19 times are complied.Kiranas should be allowed to operate normally with the aforementioned checks and balances in place. The free flow of the supply chain is the need of the hour.

In the five-month period April-August^ they launched dozens of new products — from vegetable washes to so-called immunity boosting juices and even haldi ice cream — responding to pandemic induced consumer demand and seeking to compensate for the sharp fall in categories such as skin-care and home-care. India’s third-largest listed packaged foods player ITC has launched over 40 new products in the past five months^ including vegetable washes^ surface disinfectants and immunity beverages. Just for comparison^ ITC had launched close to 60 products in the whole of last year. “The company’s innovation engine was leveraged during the pandemic to meet emerging consumer demand^” ITC chairman Sanjiv Puri said at the company’s AGM earlier this month. The manufacturing capacity of ITC’s Savlon sanitisers^ for example^ was ramped up 275 times to meet higher demand. “New products have been a critical feature for us since April 2020^” said Wipro Consumer Care & Lighting president (consumer care business) Anil Chugh. Wipro’s launch spree includes soaps^ handwashes and sanitisers^ disinfectants^ ‘anti-germ’ detergents and fabric conditioners. Advisories such as those from the Ayush ministry on turmeric also spurred product launches. Dairy giant Amul^ for example^ has launched haldi ice cream and haldi milk. “We rolled out over 40 new products within three months since the Covid-19 outbreak^” said Dabur CEO Mohit Malhotra.Dabur’s Malhotra said new launches will continue in the categories of ayurveda^ personal care and household hygiene. Retailers said there has been a 50-100% pick-up in demand for hygiene products in the past five months. Devendra Chawla^ managing director at retail chain Spencer’s Retail^ which operates over 190 stores^ said^ “There is no better time for trusted brands to leverage hygiene concerns.” Researcher Nielsen said in a report in July that demand for products such as handwash^ chyawanprash and honey more than doubled during the pandemic as shoppers chose these over other personal care products such as creams and deodorants. “New launches are in response to a definite shift in consumption patterns now centered on personal and domestic hygiene. We are intensifying our presence in these categories^” said a spokesperson for Marico^ which makes Saffola edible oils and packaged foods.

While it sees progressive normalization in the segments other than hotels ^ the recent local lockdowns posed renewed challenges.The company missed analysts’ estimates by a narrow margin as it posted a more than 26 per cent decline in its net profit to Rs 2^342.76 crore. Analysts in an ET NOW poll had expected ITC to post a profit of Rs 2^392.7 crore.Gross revenue stood at Rs 9^435.61 crore representing a decline of 17 per cent. Hotels^ cigarettes ^ education and stationery products business (ESPB) and paperboards snf packaging businesses were impacted the most due to the lockdown.The company said that other than the hotels segment^ progressive normalisation was witnessed in the latter part of the first quarter across all operating segments. The recent imposition of localized lockdowns in several parts of the country^ however^ are posing operational challenges and impacting the recovery momentum^ it added.Revenues from the hotel segment slumped nearly 94 per cent to Rs 24.92 crore from a year ago as the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic weighed heavily.Revenue from cigarettes segment declined as unprecedented disruption was witnessed across the value chain with manufacturing^ and selling and distribution operations being severely restricted following the imposition of lockdown. It also pointed that discriminatory taxation on cigarettes has caused progressive migration from consumption of duty-paid cigarettes to other lightly taxed/tax-evaded forms of tobacco products^ comprising illegal cigarettes and bidi^ chewing tobacco^ Gutkha^ Zarda^ snuff^ etc.The segment revenue^ excluding lifestyle retailing^ grew 12.2 per cent on a comparable basis^ helped by heightened awareness of quality products anchored on vectors of health^ wellness and immunity^ and the rising trend of ‘at-home’ as opposed to ‘out-of-home’ consumption.The agri business recorded a growth of 3.7 per cent in segment revenue driven by trading opportunities mainly in oilseeds and rice.Segment revenue declined by 32.8 per cent largely on account of the disruptions caused by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Significant growth in exports partly mitigated the weak domestic demand environment.

However^ this is only the latest in an increasing number of unplanned disruptions that have hit supply chains and impacting business. Looking beyond the immediate crisis^ organizations will need to build resilience in their supply chains to deal with disruptive scenarios such as natural disasters^ trade barriers^ civil unrest^ terrorism^ cyber-attacks and epidemics.Traditional supply chains focused on cost optimization through a lean and just-in-time inventory model^ with high geographic and vendor concentration^ and limited flexibility in manufacturing sites and routes to market. The COVID-19 disruption has exposed fault lines in last mile connectivity ^ centralized manufacturing & warehousing^ access to migrant workforce^ and dependence on channel partners and vendors in impacted geographies.The new normal demands a better balance between risk mitigation and business continuity on one hand and cost optimization on the other. This doesn’t mean that companies need to start becoming cost uncompetitive by building in resilience. Instead^ building capabilities and alternate strategies that help them become more agile and balance costs and profits is the need of the hour. This can be achieved by adopting emerging technologies to continuously drive efficiencies from the supply chain .A set of key imperatives^ as listed below; can guide organizations through this transformation.Routes to market must become digital^ transparent and agile to enable organizations to control the last mile and fulfill consumer demand either by going direct-to-consumer or through a partner network. A few FMCG companies have turned the ongoing crisis into an opportunity by strengthening e-commerce^ enabling a digital^ contactless salesforce powered through deep-learning analytics^ virtual order taking^ and app-based order taking and delivery tracking.As industries restart with constrained liquidity and cost pressures^ leading organizations are driving initiatives to cut supply chain complexity. This often starts with narrowing the focus to fewer core products with strong consumer value proposition^ while still retaining a bulk share of revenue. Existing transactional data can be leveraged to build analytical models that help in simplifying the product portfolio^ identifying must sell SKUs by channel partners and market^ and streamlining inventory norms and distribution flow paths for the retained portfolio.Organizations will need to establish scenario-based planning capability to synchronize supply fulfilment in a highly dynamic and evolving demand environment. Planning needs to occur on a daily and weekly cadence^ instead of monthly^ with tighter feedback loops between execution and planning cycles.Organizations need to reassess the customer demand based on the outbreak-driven market adjustments (i.e. new demand driven by change in demand/supply constrictions)^ review supply constraints (i.e.^ suppliers^ transport^ warehousing active capacities)^ create a prioritisation framework based on business continuity rather than just profit optimization and prepare for a range of demand and supply possibilities.Even as plants and factories reopen^ most sites are struggling to achieve their previous capacity due to labour shortages and material constraints. Manufacturing shop floor operations should be transformed through low cost automation systems to reduce manual operations and improve productivity. Organizations must segment workforce into critical/non-critical and design adaptive staffing plans to be able to run the plant with a skeleton staff if the need arises.Where possible^ organizations should explore localized production options with sites and contract manufactures situated closer to key markets.Disruptions can be mitigated through technology solutions that provide end-to-end visibility and collaboration across the value chain^ linking critical first to third-tier suppliers with manufacturers^ distributors and customers. As an example^ a large automotive OEM has invested in a technology platform to enable advance visibility to potential constraints across production lines^ supplier capacity and manpower^ thus enabling rapid corrective action and communication to impacted stakeholders.Organizations will benefit from designing a comprehensive resilience strategy and investing in areas such as visibility and monitoring capability (i.e. control tower)^ alternative supplier sourcing strategies^ critical component substitutes^ and ongoing financial health monitoring of suppliers.The shift towards a more agile^ responsive and resilient supply chain begins with keeping employees informed^ motivated^ committed and trained. Organizations must initiate or expand flexible and remote working arrangements^ develop strong communications and employee support programs.Dealing with labour shortages will require cross-training and upskilling of the workforce to improve flexibility. Organizational structure in conjunction with standard operating procedures (SOPs) and Delegation of Authority (DOA) should be reviewed to enable rapid response during disruptions.In order to be better prepared for future disruptions^ organizations need to create a crisis management ‘war room’ with end-to-end supply chain visibility from customers to suppliers^ that can enable the organization to identify early warning signals and take proactive decisions.The emergence of new technologies like artificial intelligence ( AI )^ machine learning (ML)^ the Internet of Things (IoT)^ additive manufacturing (3-D printing) and advanced analytics^ when applied to the various parts of the supply chain as mentioned above^ enhances the organization’s ability to make more informed decisions. As we move from the ‘Now’ to the ‘Next’ and ‘Beyond’ phase of the COVID-19 pandemic^ these initiatives will need to be fast-tracked to not only address the immediate aftermath but to make supply chains more resilient for the future.( Ashish Nanda is Partner and India Leader and Nishit Bhatia^ Partner^ Supply Chain and Operations^ EY)

Rural has still not picked up. Rural supply chains is taking longer to rebuild than urban India. We will have to see how rural demand shapes up once supply chain is restored^” Edelweiss analyst said.“Revival of demand for beauty and personal care products will decide future growth trajectory. The pandemic has imposed incremental operating costs on the business. Thus^ there would be margin impact in the short term^” it added. Motilal Oswal expects HUL to report a 1.9 per cent decline in net profit^ while sales may drop by 1 per cent.A few were^ however^ a bit optimistic. HDFC Securities expects HUL to report a 9.8 per cent rise in adjusted net profit.

Industry estimates this may shoot up to over 4-5% this year.According to the latest Nielsen report^ online contribution to India's FMCG sales rose nearly 50% year-on-year in the March quarter as consumers increasingly shopped from e-grocers^ while local grocer's share fell 220 basis points^ entirely overtaken by ecommerce and modern retailers.BK Rao^ senior category head of India’s largest food company^ Parle Products^ said demand for online purchases during lockdown shot up by even 100x^ but companies could not fulfil it due to worker shortages and supply disruptions.“But now that those issues are solved^ there will be a big jump in sales^” he said.

While the festival of lights has sparked surging demand for consumer durable and electronics industry that is working to meet demand for everything from smartphones to refrigerators^ fashion and lifestyle retailers are paring orders amid a demand slump.Apparel vendors nationwide that service the vast number of mom-and-pop shops and small retailers that controls almost 70% of the Diwali apparel markets said orders for Diwali has shrunk to about 30% this time from last year. Larger players like Biba and Manyavar – that also rely heavily for business in India’s biggest festive season - are cutting productions and orders by almost 40% for the current fiscal year ending March 2021.“We have already reduced our orders by 40%^” said Siddharath Bindra^ MD of Biba Apparels that operates more than 200 enthnic wear stores. He said like Biba^ a lot of retailers are slashing orders for August to January months. “Obviously there is no business. The lockdowns and shutdowns have left us with a lot of unsold inventory. So we have enough merchandise for Diwali.”Bindra said he will gauge the consumer response in August and September to place orders for next summer season starting February 2021. In any case^ he believes that order reductions would be 30-50% even for the initial months of 2021.This is in contrast to the situation for electronic enterprises. Smartphones and consumer electronic goods makers like LG^ Xiaomi^ Vivo^ Realme and Panasonic have advanced their festive season production plans by a month and will lift output to last year’s levels or even more. These companies saw double-digit growth in the just concluded online sales in Amazon and Flipkart.LG India is scaling up production by 10-15% for the festive season and its plants are running two shifts and working Sundays. Dixon^ a contract manufacturer for Xiaomi^ Samsung and Panasonic^ is expanding capacity for washing machines and televisions by up to 40% due to big orders from clients. Realme^ Vivo and Samsung too have expanded production.Demand has outstripped supply for categories such as smartphones and dishwashers^ even products like refrigerators^ televisions and washing machines have seen sales rising 40-60% since May.Executives at FMCG companies said festive demand pick-up is some time away since the main festive season starts only after two months.RS Sodhi^ MD of dairy giant Amul said “Demand for festive packs is still some time away. On Raksha Bandhan^ though^ we saw good numbers.”Deepak Iyer^ Managing Director^ Mondelez India^ said his company’s research showed that consumers are looking forward to the festive season.“The key concern is how the pandemic will shape up over the next few months and what will be their financial position^” he said. “How the festive season plays out will depend on these two factors. We are keeping a close watch on these factors to evaluate our actions closer to the festivals.”Fashion and lifestyle retailers are keeping their fingers crossed stunned in the pandemic due to months-long lockdown and then closure of a chunk of their stores due to mall shutdowns and erratic opening hours in high-streets.A July survey by the Retailers Association of India said fashion^ footwear and jewellery segments were among the worst retailing segments impacted by the pandemic generating hardly 30% of business compared to the same period last year.Ethnicwear company Manyavar would generally clock about 25-30% year-on-year growth every Diwali but has scaled down expectations this year.“We will be happy to if we generate 70-80% compared to last Diwali^” said Dalpat Jain^ chief financial officer of Manyavar.The impact is felt by the Clothing Manufacturing Association of India and the group said Diwali orders from retailers currently are “negligible.”Every year^ this is the peak production time for Surat-based sari and lehega choli supplier Manjula Fashions ^ but this year output is at about a fifth of its capacity due to lack of demand.“Everybody is having a financial crisis at their own level so everyone is in spending less mode^” said Mayur Chheda^ owner of the firm. “So it is having a direct impact on our business.”Similarly^ Mumbai-based salwar kameez wholesaler Khushi said orders have tanked by 75% this Diwali.“It will at least take a year for us to cover our losses^” said Jitendra Gada of Khushi. “After that^ we are hoping for a recovery and to earn something.”

The companies are expected to spend more on distribution outreach^ consumer promotions and products in rural India than in urban markets this year.“We believe 2020 will be the year of rural markets . Higher MNREGA spends^ reverse migration and good monsoon have led to a surge in rural consumption^” said Varun Berry^ managing director^ Britannia Industries. The rural market is now growing at three times the pace of urban for the biscuits and dairy giant^ which now has more than 21^000 rural distributors. “We are leveraging rural buoyancy by increasing the reach and penetration of low unit price packs of both premium and value portfolios^” Berry said.On Monday^ a report by credit ratings firm CARE Ratings said the southwest monsoon^ with rains at a six-year high so far^ could be a catalyst for rural demand. The agriculture sector contributes nearly 15% to GDP^ and the economy is banking on the farm sector to grow 3.5-4% across all quarters this year to prop up overall economic growth^ it said. While company executives cautioned about the risk from the spread of Covid-19 in rural and semi-urban areas^ they said much of the focus this year was on these markets.“With urban growth and discretionary spending continuing to be constrained^ we are investing heavily on rural markets this year. Macro indicators of growth are visible in rural India^” said Saugata Gupta^ managing director of Marico that makes Saffola edible oils and Parachute hair-care products.Companies are pinning hopes on a rural bounce back fuelled by higher farm income^ good monsoon^ government stimulus and reduced impact of lockdowns on agriculture activities^ as macro indicators suggest challenges in the immediate term to a revival in the overall economy. On Tuesday^ Fitch Ratings slashed its projection on India’s economy for FY21 - it now expects the economy to shrink 10.5%^ compared with a 5% contraction estimated previously. “With the lockdown easing now^ we plan to restart the expansion of our rural footprint and expand our product basket with newer low unit price packs across categories to feed these markets and push demand^” Dabur chief executive Mohit Malhotra said.

But commercial vehicle traffic on the highways has gradually increased after the lockdown measures were relaxed^ though movement of passenger vehicles remain muted.“We have analysed the toll data for over 600 national highway toll plazas. June-July traffic data shows that it’s back to almost 80% of February levels. Agriculture and commodities^ cement^ ecommerce and FMCG were the key drivers for the commercial traffic growth^” Isha Chaudhary^ director^ CRISIL Research ^ told ET.Rating agency ICRA said July toll collections were around 85% of pre-Covid levels. “Overall^ the traffic in the first four months of FY2021 has rebounded quite well^ which is encouraging. This is also corroborated by the e-way bills generated. This pace of recovery^ if sustained^ the overall reduction in toll collections for national highway projects could be less than 10% in FY2021^” said Rajeshwar Burla^ vice president^ corporate ratings^ ICRA.Industry experts point out that overall traffic growth in 2019-20 was almost flat due to the economic slowdown and change in axle load norms^ after a 7-8% compounded annual growth rate in FY17-19. Despite the low base of FY20^ the disruption caused in the first few months for FY21^ coupled with the low utilisation levels of commercial vehicles^ may result in a 10-15% annual decline in toll collection.IRB Infrastructure Developers^ one of the largest private roads and highways developers^ said the phase-wise relaxation in lockdown has helped improve toll collection for June 2020 to 75% of pre-Covid levels^ and there are signs of improvement.“Toll collections were temporarily soft due to frequent and persisting lockdowns in the April-June quarter. With the phase-wise relaxations being implemented now^ normalcy is expected soon^ as is also reflected in collections for June 2020 surpassing 75% levels on year-on-year basis and improving further in July^” said Virendra Mhaiskar^ chairman and managing director^ IRB. “Construction activity is bouncing back gradually as well.”With most of national highway stretches being arterial routes^ about 75% of the toll collection comes from commercial vehicles. While the CV traffic may be inching close to the pre-Covid levels^ passenger traffic is still around half of the pre-pandemic levels.The roads industry will be closely monitoring traffic growth in the second half of the current fiscal^ as their ability to service debt and credit profile hinges on a pickup in economic activity.“Next year^ we expect a v-shaped recovery in toll traffic because the base would be low and some pent up demand would be released^ and many sectors may pick up^” Crisil’s Chaudhary said.

Moreover^ there will also be re-calibration of channels such as e-commerce^ which has increased its penetration and prominence among the customers post lockdown^ he added.""If you look at e-commerce channels^ in the US what took eight years in terms of penetration^ it has been achieved in eight weeks (of lockdown). Clearly the e-commerce journey is here to stay and there will be re-calibration of channels^"" Narayanan told .Post-COVID-19^ Nestle's entire innovation funnel is also undergoing a change to engage with the customers under a new normal.""Every business is recalibrating in the context of newly relevant consumer behaviours that are coming in^ that is^ what innovations we should go with^ what innovation should be left out^"" he explained.Narayanan said he believes that in crisis^ one should engage not disengage. ""If we disengage then the consumer has other choices^"" he added.Like others^ Nestle has also witnessed a rise in its 'in-home indulgence' segment of products and introduced new products under 'MAGGI- Cooking Made Simple' service.""The words quality^ safety^ nutrition and trust have undergone sharper re-definition and consumers tend to favour 'tried and tested' brands and relationships formed herein ^"" the CMD said. There is a new word that has been added to the lexicon of consumer needs in the pandemic^ which is 'immunity' for self and the family^ he added.While talking about sales^ Narayanan said that Nestle India is witnessing a better growth in the rural and semi-urban areas^ where the market has recovered quickly after lockdown-related disruptions.Besides^ the company is also witnessing a surge in sales from e-commerce channels^ he said.""We have witnessed better growth in tier 2^ 3^ 4 cities^ semi-urban areas than urban areas during the lockdown. Rural consumption continues to be stronger than urban demand. We delivered a strong performance in the e-commerce channel^"" said Narayanan.Like other FMCG companies^ Nestle has also witnessed a sharp decline in its ""Out of Home"" consumption channels as restrictions on several channels as restaurants^ hotels^ cafes etc^ which form bulk of the segment^ continued.However^ its ""in-home consumption"" was up and sales of Everyday Dairy Whitener^ Nestle a+ Milk^ another milk-based portfolio^ Nescafe performed well this quarter^ Narayanan said.""Maggi also witnessed solid growth towards the end of the quarter after initial supply constraints^"" he said.According to Narayanan^ now the Indian economy is showing signs of recovery after the initial impact of COVID-19 though some of the sectors were impacted more than the others.""With the easing of restrictions on economic activities^ businesses are slowly getting back on track. To address these concerns in such challenging times^ the Government of India has announced several measures to ensure business continuity and sectoral revival^"" he added."

However^ the experts say that it will also depend on GDP growth^ commodity inflation^ good monsoon^ among others.The experts also opine that a high double digit growth seems distant in 2020 for the FMCG sector.""It should (FMCG) recover after two quarters. One or two quarters^ will remain tough and this all would be linked to GDP. If GDP growth comes back to 6.5 to 7 per cent^ then the recovery would happen.

We have also introduced multiple promotions/consumer offers and Communication of the same has been sharpened to highlight benefits to consumers in terms of lower prices or promotions^"" according to ITC.Harsha Razdan^ Partner and Head - Consumer Markets and Internet Business^ KPMG in India said that FMCG makers are also trying to leverage the consumption appetite of small tier-two plus cities with a select range of their premium products packaged in more affordable formats.""While^ we did witness a brief slowdown last year^ increased Internet penetration and use of smartphones have ensured that rural regional markets are now at the forefront of the consumption race. They are tech-savvy^ digitally aware and already have a sense of the product/brand that the market offers. FMCG companies are trying to leverage this consumption appetite of smaller cities with a select range of their premium products packaged in more affordable formats^"" Razdan said.Besides liquidity pressure^ consumer sentiments were also weak because of no job addition^ and salary hike was muted in 2019. Also^ floods in several parts impacted rural demand and high food inflation due to spike in milk and onion prices impacted consumer wallet.""Rural growth is normally ahead of urban growth (in FMCG) but in the last six moths^ it was below urban and specially in the last four months^ it was half of urban^"" he said.According to a report from rating agency Nielsen^ rural India contributes 36 per cent to overall FMCG spends and has historically been growing around 3-5 per cent points faster than urban. However in recent periods^ rural growth is slowing down at a much faster rate compared to urban.While releasing the July-September snapshot for the FMCG industry^ Nielsen had said that it was the ""worst performance by rural India in last seven years"".""For the first time in the last 7 years^ rural growth has dropped below urban. Rural is growing at 5 per cent in Q3'19^ which is 1/4th as compared to 20 per cent in Q3'18^ while urban is growing at 8 per cent as against 14 per cent growth in Q3'18.^"" it said.However^ Roy said that FMCG would come back and there is enough head room to grow. Still FCMG consumption is one fourth of China and rural is one fourth of urban India.""Rural has to catch up with urban India. Food inflation is back^ commodity inflation is back and this is good for FCMG companies from price prospective. Last one year price growth in FMCG was very minimal as it was not required. Now^ milk and palm oil are up^ … which means that there would be price growth of 3-4 per cent for many of the companies^"" he said.However^ some companies^ as Nestle ^ which has lesser rural exposure^ performed well in 2019 as it saw double-digit domestic growth between January and September.According to IBEF report^ fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector is the fourth largest sector in the Indian economy with household and personal care accounting for 50 per cent of FMCG sales in India."

Brew House is one such startup that offers certified bottled iced tea. Part of the Positive Food Ventures and founded in 2017^ the company is a collaborative effort of Food Empire Holdings of Singapore and Siddharth Jain ^ who is also the founder of Brew House Ice Tea.Jain always harboured entrepreneurial ambitions^ and he realised that ice tea had become a huge beverage category globally^ amounting to $65 billion^ and growing on the back of rising health concerns. ""I believed that the trend would inevitably hit India^ but it needed to be done the right way to be meaningful. It had to be proper tea^ with no artificial ingredients and less sugar^ which had never been done in India before^"" says Jain.Jain says they built the core team brick by brick over time^ with people who believe in the product and vision. ""I put in 50 lakh of my money to get this off the ground. That included developing the first batches of perfect-tasting ice teas^ starting to build a brand^ and eventually creating the first real stock of inventory. After that^ we had help from an angel investor^ and eventually^ larger institutional investors.""Brew House has investments from angel investor Dheeraj Jain and the Food Empire Group of Singapore. Brew House is closing a fresh round of investment that they hope to announce soon. Brewhouse started with an initial investment of $600^000 from Singapore Exchange-listed global FMCG company Food Empire. In September 2018^ they raised an additional $2 million in funding.Jain said that in the initial days when India became aware of COVID-19^ Brew House's sales took a hit and they had to rationalise the workforce. ""Around mid-March^ we had already started asking our employees to work from home^ that is continuing^ and we are keeping their safety as our number one priority^"" Jain shared. As lockdown restrictions began to ease^ Jain says there has been an improvement in sales and new online channel has opened up. The founder believes the pandemic has ensured that customers are much more health conscious and looking for healthier products.Brew House is now set to launch new ice tea products - ginger turmeric lemonade and strawberry hibiscus lemonade. The startup promises the new products to be both highly innovative and taste great^ and most importantly^ a great immunity booster. The startup will also launch low-calorie ice teas.Brew House has been aggressively working with both smaller cloud kitchens^ and hospitality brands such as Taj Palace Mumbai and the ITC Grand Bharat apart from direct online sales through their platforms. As people feel the need for an organic beverage brand that offers cleaner^ healthier products^ Brew House now has an enormous opportunity to sell in a space where the consumer post-COVID-19 has become very conscious about health and what they consume.""We have seen a 10x growth from the start of the lockdown to now^ in August^ and we hope that this will continue to rise as people become more aware of what they are eating and drinking^"" Jain revealed. ""The antioxidant properties of organic and real-brewed tea helps to maintain a strong immune system and as a result^ can help people fight off illnesses. We hope more and more people see the benefit of this and choose to not switch back to regular drinking over-sweetened sugary drinks."""

20 Jul^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/there-are-4-main-consumption-drivers-in-post-covid-india-nielsen-global-connect/articleshow/77065176.cms,Economic Times,There are 4 main consumption drivers in post-Covid India: Nielsen Global Connect,Healthy food^ personal and home hygiene^ medical expenses and fitness are main consumer drivers ^ Then there is education and then entertainment and investment^ says Pasun Basu ^ president^ South Asia^ Nielsen Global Connect There is a little bit of pent-up demand. In fact^ some of our consumer trends are showing that as well and I will come to that^ but whether we expect this to go down in a significant way in the coming months^ I do not think so. People were in a bit of a kind of confide mode and there was a “break free” that was needed and some of the consumer trends are clearly showing that break free tendency. So an upsurge in June is coming from that. It is largely sustainable and is almost coming up to the pre-Covid levels that is as it was in December^ January and February. Most of this will sustain.Till May^ we were seeing a very big difference with the discretionary items staying really low and a lot of de-growth while the essentials were still doing well. In June^ we find there has been an overall increase. For example^ beauty care demand has gone up though it is still below the pre-Covid levels. Daily necessity items like toothpaste^ shampoos^ hair oils^ washing powders have gone up and they are starting to rail slightly above the pre-Covid levels. That is where the combination of pent-up demand and real sustainable demand comes in.Anything to do with hygiene^ has really been going up. So the very heightened hygiene situation is there and those are trailing anywhere in the range of 10% to 20% over the pre-Covid levels. Anything to do with hygiene categories like liquid toilet soaps^ floor cleaners also. Even the discretionary categories are starting to get some spending.Let us look at the basic consumer drivers. Where are the consumers spending most of their money? They are saying the top one is healthy food and just note the points. So healthy food is the first one^ personal and home hygiene is the second one^ medical expenses is the third one^ fitness is the fourth one and then there is education and then entertainment and investment.If you look at it^ there are three buckets – one is anything to do with health^ healthy food^ hygiene^ medical and fitness^ then it is education. There is obviously entertainment and there is investment. That is where they want to spend more money. They are really building the blocks for their future sustenance. They are building a strong armour from a long-term standpoint and what they are going to go down on. The big ones that consumers will go down on are dining out^ travel^ luxury brand spends^ new cars^ new bikes^ tobacco and apparel.So^ one can see really that entertainment areas are going to dramatically come down and that is where the balancing of the budget and wallet will happen and big times spend on health^ education to some extent and then investment will be done to secure the future.The other big trend that is happening which is very important is that people are starting to break free. So when you look at questions like will you cover your mask when you go outside^ will you stay away from public gatherings etc -- some of those numbers are very high^ but they are dropping. People are getting really restless and want to come out of the house. People are restless about keeping masks on. So while those are very high numbers^ they have dropped by 10-15%. So^ something that was 90%^ has dropped to 85%^ something was 85% has dropped to 70%. What has gone up in the same situation is home remedies to boost immunity.Long-term^ people are still saying that they will use masks^ follow social distancing six months down the line. So^ half of the society is still going to follow these norms but the other half is starting to break free and they are saying let me do something long term. As a result^ you will find big category shifts happening over time.Categories which cater to these fundamental trends of health hygiene^ fitness^ exercises^ etc^ will do well and communicate on those lines and launch products on those lines could do well^ something to do with education will do well but all of these other entertainment options that we are talking about they are going to dramatically going down. There will be a very big rebalance of categories in my mind even within FMCG and outside of FMCG a lot more.Rural market is picking up a lot^ very good questions. We were forecasting that rural will go up in the coming months and we have forecast growth in the second half of the year^ but it is really heartening to see that rural has gone up already to around 8% to 9% more than pre-Covid levels. That is a very promising trend and that is coming out of good monsoons which are already happening.The rabi crop has been very good and with a reverse migration^ rural heavy parts of the country are actually getting a boost of 1% to 2%. So everything put together. rural is up 8-9% over the pre-Covid period and I definitely feel rural demand will sustain. The next six to nine months will be the time for rural India. We have tried to do some forecasting here. We have said that in the next nine months -- between July and March next year -- we are going to possibly see 4-5% overall FMCG growth but the rural growth will be almost double of the urban growth. If urban grows in the 2% to 3% range^ rural will grow maybe in the range of 6% or so. That is the kind of rural growth that we are expecting to see^As long as Covid stays contained^ I expect those forecasts to come through. It is showing around 8% growth in June versus pre-Covid times.Let me give you some very interesting stats on both traditional trade and e-commerce. It is true that the bigger theme here is digitalisation and e-commerce is obviously digital but traditional trade is also very fast becoming digital. Today around 10% plus have digitised in spite of the huge store base that we have.Interestingly^ the June data shows that traditional trade has bounced back by 27 points and traditional trade sales are almost back to the pre-Covid level. Stores were closed for 12 days in April^ from around 10-11 days in March. There were only 3-4 days of stores closures in June. So traditional trade stores are now mostly open. Digitisation is happening and it has bounced back by 27 points all the way to pre-Covidlevels.On the other hand^ e-commerce is still the most preferred contactless method of getting stuff. When you ask people about their preferred mode of delivery^ e-commerce is at the top at 40%^ home delivery from neighbourhood shops comes next at 34% and all other home delivery of aggregators^ etc^ comes to another 30%. Both these have gone up by 9% over a couple of months. So there’s a 9% increase in both home delivery from neighbour stores as well as food aggregators. On the other hand^ visiting stores to the point that Milind said they are down in the range of 10% to 25%. The number of neighbourhood stores are down by around 10% whereas department stores and^ modern trade are down almost by half.You will find this rebalance where we will have to reach the staff to the consumer doorsteps^ to the consumers home and as long as we reach it^ both hyper local and e-commerce will do well. We are finding in the data that traditional trade is doing very well and e-commerce is doing well and all these delivery modes are doing well. There are different avenues and channels upto the doorstep of the consumer and so contactless is going to be the word for the future.

Similarly Q2 2020 recorded just 90 M&A deals as compared to 231 in Q1 2020^ a drop of 61%. The telecommunications sector grew 220x in comparison to last year in terms of deal value in Q2 2020 the deal value increased by 19% primarily due to a big ticket deal in which Facebook acquired Jio Platforms from Reliance Industries for $5.73 billion through its wholly owned subsidiary Jaadhu Holdings LLC.In the first half of the calendar year 2020^ out of all deal categories like inbound^ outbound and domestic^ the greatest M&A deal activity was witnessed in the domestic category which recorded 179 deals compared to 38 inbound and 24 outbound deals. The activity in the domestic category accounted for 64% of the overall deal activity; amounting to $11.9 billion of the total $22.8 billion seen in the first half of 2020.With the onset of the pandemic^ there has been a dip in the count of deals across sectors^ however Telecommunications^ Financials^ Healthcare and Consumer Staples have been able to up their percentage share marginally in terms of count of deals in the overall tally. Some sectors have or will be worse hit than others^ such as the ill-fated aviation and hospitality industries^ while others such as FMCG^ pharma and other 'essential' sectors can benefit.""The crisis may open up some buy-side opportunities^ leveraging on the lower valuations in the short term to seek higher return on capital in the long term.While the current deal activity is down^ distress takeovers might provide new energy and we might witness potential delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Cross border deals would also take a hit as PEs and MNCs look to conserve cash.""said Sahaj R Kumar^ Head- Research^ VCCEdge ^ in a statement.The global business lockdown has created opportunities for Indian firms waiting with cash eyeing quality international assets.In light of the economic slowdown^ the government has announced multiple incentives for various sectors. For instance^ the recently announced lower corporate tax regime with an effective rate of 17.16% for manufacturing companies^ coupled with several production-linked incentive schemes such as the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors ( SPECS ) are likely to improve the domestic supply chain and invite a share of global manufacturing to India.The global business disruption due to the worldwide lockdown has not just put firms on a reset mode but also pushed thousands of companies on the road to bankruptcy. Many would begin to consider consolidation to ensure business continuity.According to VCCEdge^ the folly of putting most eggs in one basket is now more than apparent to the global majors and this creates a picture where MNCs would look more seriously at putting up an India base to derisk their supply chains.Post COVID-19^ the 'Make In India' initiative of the government has received more impetus. Hence^ there could be seen a growing number of investments and consolidations in India origin firms so as to be more prepared for the future. Furthermore^ with the migrant workforce being dispersed in the lockdown era^ it could trigger the need for localised investments and consolidations at the state level as well."

Allowances may encompass gadgets such as laptops or printers^ mental and physical health apps^ home office furniture^ expenses for domestic help or for childcare^ since office creches are unlikely to be used^ according to lawyers specialising in employment and labour laws.“We are not changing the CTC of people though we may have to restructure it^” said Suresh Tripathi^ vice president^ human resources^ Tata Steel. “We will keep the tax component in mind while restructuring^ so that the employee does not lose out on anything… Moreover^ we will give flexibility to employees to decide on the kind of allowance they want to opt for.”“We aim to keep components of an employee’s salary separate from business-related expense reimbursements^ such as mobile or internet reimbursement^” said Supratik Bhattacharya^ chief talent officer^ RPG Group. “We recognise that any allowance that is structured to be a part of an employee’s salary is a portion of her/his rightful compensation. In the days to come^ we do see an increasing number of people working from home^ and we are definitely exploring options^ ways and means of making remote working not just more productive for the organisation^ but also comfortable for the employee.”Sandeep Mehta^ partner at J Sagar Associates (JSA)^ said: “At the forefront of the change will be sectors such as IT and IT services^ banking and financial services^ law firms^ professional services^ and new-age companies^ which have fast adopted the ability to work from outside the office in the post-pandemic era.”“Companies are beginning to plan things taking into account that the Covid situation may last longer than originally expected^” said Sonu Iyer^ partner^ people advisory services^ EY . “We will see increase in variable pay structures across sectors…Variabalisation of compensation would help companies retain talent as also drive business performance.”Policies such as POSH are being tweaked to add a focus on online harassment^ while that on IT will pay greater attention to cyber and data security. “Companies are tweaking their policies to make the laws pertaining to digital harassment more explicit^” said Vishal Kedia^ director^ ComplyKaro^ which specialises in such cases.

Allowances may encompass gadgets such as laptops or printers^ mental and physical health apps^ home office furniture^ expenses for domestic help or for childcare^ since office creches are unlikely to be used^ according to lawyers specialising in employment and labour laws.“We are not changing the CTC of people though we may have to restructure it^” said Suresh Tripathi^ vice president^ human resources^ Tata Steel. “We will keep the tax component in mind while restructuring^ so that the employee does not lose out on anything… Moreover^ we will give flexibility to employees to decide on the kind of allowance they want to opt for.”“We aim to keep components of an employee’s salary separate from business-related expense reimbursements^ such as mobile or internet reimbursement^” said Supratik Bhattacharya^ chief talent officer^ RPG Group. “We recognise that any allowance that is structured to be a part of an employee’s salary is a portion of her/his rightful compensation. In the days to come^ we do see an increasing number of people working from home^ and we are definitely exploring options^ ways and means of making remote working not just more productive for the organisation^ but also comfortable for the employee.”Sandeep Mehta^ partner at J Sagar Associates (JSA)^ said: “At the forefront of the change will be sectors such as IT and IT services^ banking and financial services^ law firms^ professional services^ and new-age companies^ which have fast adopted the ability to work from outside the office in the post-pandemic era.”“Companies are beginning to plan things taking into account that the Covid situation may last longer than originally expected^” said Sonu Iyer^ partner^ people advisory services^ EY . “We will see increase in variable pay structures across sectors…Variabalisation of compensation would help companies retain talent as also drive business performance.”Policies such as POSH are being tweaked to add a focus on online harassment^ while that on IT will pay greater attention to cyber and data security. “Companies are tweaking their policies to make the laws pertaining to digital harassment more explicit^” said Vishal Kedia^ director^ ComplyKaro^ which specialises in such cases. The message is that WFH is the new workplace and all facets and harassment laws related to the workplace apply. Tata Steel has tweaked its policy to include a “special leave” provision for any employee who might need to self-quarantine or stay away from office over concerns about exposure Covid.

30 Apr^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/mission-accomplished-saving-private-labels-in-covid-season/articleshow/75462232.cms,Economic Times,Mission accomplished: Saving private labels in Covid season,BENGALURU: At a time when consumers are looking for low-cost options and as products from large FMCG players have become scarce on online platforms^ players such as BigBasket Amazon and Flipkart have seen sales of their private labels in essential categories grow strongly.Industry executives and analysts told ET that private brands in categories such as pulses^ detergents and personal care have received a boost over the past five weeks as the country went under lockdown to stem the spread of the outbreak. Consumers are preferring to buy lower-cost alternatives to tried and tested brands as spending is hit due to the uncertainty surrounding the economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic ^ experts said.For instance^ Amazon’s Presto brand floor cleaner is 25% cheaper than rival Reckitt Benckiser’s market leading Lizol. A similar product from BigBasket is priced at least 15% lower^ while Flipkart’s Supermart-branded floor cleaner is 50% cheaper than Lizol. BigBasket and Grofers said they have been able to directly work with manufacturers to make staples and hygiene products available faster than traditional FMCG channels.This momentum is expected to continue in the mid- to longterm^ with India’s largest e-grocer BigBasket expecting the contribution of private labels to overall sales to rise to 45% from 35% in the next six months. “Certain categories like health^ bakery^ organic milk^ ghee^ chocolates^ snacks will drive this growth^” said Hari Menon^ CEO of BigBasket.Rival Grofers is also looking at private labels accounting for 60% of sales^ up from 40% in the same timeframe. “We plan to invest $15 million in our owned brands over the next year and are looking to invest $25-50 million in the supply chain and owned brands combined over the next two years^” Albinder Dhindsa^ CEO of Grofers told ET.Grofers wants to increase the availability of its private brands from 350 corner stores to 2^000 in the next six months^ he added.“Our goal is to provide customers with more choices and we work closely with local manufacturer^ brands and sellers to fill selection gaps with products that they are searching for^” an Amazon spokesperson told ET. Flipkart did not respond to ET’s queries seeking comment. Ecommerce firms have also been able to scale up supply of private labels more meaningfully than that of products from thirdparty brands amid the ongoing lockdown. “We were in talks^ and continue to be in talks^ with all large FMCG brands^ but even they have been facing challenges in terms of opening up factories and getting back labour^” said a senior executive at a leading ecommerce marketplace.
22 Jul^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/can-it-be-the-next-fmcg-for-the-market-ashwini-agarwal-explains/articleshow/77102437.cms,Economic Times,Can IT be the next FMCG for the market? Ashwini Agarwal explains,The co-founder offollows four principles while investing and these are: a focus on necessities over discretionary ^ market leadership^ balance sheet and export potential. He says you can’t go wrong if you pick stocks following these mantras.A massive amount of liquidity has come into the market and that is driving up stock prices. It is not different from what we are seeing elsewhere in the world. Central banks across the world have pushed money into the hands of people^ households and a lot of that money has gone into the markets.For about two years^ the Indian market was very tight on liquidity and now we have a significant amount of surplus liquidity in the system and some of it is percolating into the market. Like you correctly mentioned^ the institutional participation has been relatively muted at least in the secondary market but the institutions have been participating in the primary market where there are new fundraisings via rights issue^ QIPs and now the IPO market is starting to come back. It is not all gloom and doom.Slowly people are looking at opportunities and are starting to participate. Of course^ there is an overarching fear that the economy is not doing well and there is a huge amount of retail participation and so is this the classic market top yet again.At the end of March^ we sat down and said that okay the economy is going to be in a tough spot^ what do we do? We said that we are going to move our portfolio along four axes. First is the focus on necessities over discretionary^ every product falls somewhere on that scale where on one extreme you might have complete discretionary demand -- like going to a carnival as you mentioned -- or at the other end^ you would have a complete necessity demand like buying toothpaste and everything else is somewhere in the middle. So try and move as close to necessities as possible and keep the discretionary element low.Second^ which I am beginning to realise is probably a bigger theme than even necessities over discretionary is leadership. Since the market is in a tough spot^ because there are select people consuming and because banks want to lend very carefully^ leadership is going to play a major role in winning market share. In times of trouble^ you should move more towards leadership and get out of number three^ number four market share players. So^ that is something that we have done.The third is to focus on balance sheet quality. It is not that we were buying overleveraged companies earlier^ but the focus on cash flows and balance sheet has become even more important.Lastly^ focus on exports because the western economies might come out of this with fewer cuts and bruises than India will. So in a sense^ the recovery in the markets in the western economies or recovery in the western economies is going to be a little bit earlier as compared to what we might see in India^ which might be a deeper U or a L-shaped recovery.I agree with you. If you think about the four parameters that I pointed out a) spotlight^ b) very strong balance sheet^ c) leadership in their chosen area of expertise within the broader domain of IT; and last but not the least^ a lot of the services that they provide have a lower discretionary element than we probably appreciate. So within the IT space^ discretionary projects might be put on hold but providing mobility^ providing work from home^ providing additional layers of security^ providing key business architecture are the things that should have been done yesterday. So people who have not done them^ are rushing to get them done. So^ yes IT services is in a good place.Now whether they give the kind of returns that consumer stocks gave over the last three years or not^ I do not know. But I am favourably disposed towards IT services.These are very difficult predictions to make. Our view has been that the US dollar should structurally weaken. It has been extremely strong for almost a decade now and with the kind of deficits that they are playing with and the kind of slower growth that we are anticipating^ one should expect the dollar to weaken. Now the problem is what does the US dollar weaken against? Does it weaken against real assets which are gold as you pointed out or commodities or other real assets like the real estate sector? Or does it weaken against emerging market currencies? Unless convinced about the latter^ I think the former sounds like a promising argument.However^ if you look at what global strategists like Jan Dehn says^ he expects the emerging market currencies to do much better than the US dollar for the simple reason that the external account or the fiscal account deficits that are being run in emerging markets are far lower than what we have seen in the western world.These economies are much better positioned today than they were at any point in time during the previous crisis in terms of the kind of imbalances that they were running with. So yes^ there is a case for that but let us see how it plays out.Let me take a step back. There are different challenges for each individual market. Some markets are significantly driven by specific commodities. Some markets do have a problem on their fiscal side or problem on their external account side and India has its own set of problems. We are living in a world where you have to do a lot more analysis on each market and make up your mind where you stand. While what you point out is right and India is relatively expensive in the emerging space. We probably have a bigger fiscal deficit in the short run than many other emerging economies. I also think that very large domestic demand and a reasonably healthy banking sector are positives. Bulk of our NPL pains have been provided for in the last three or four years and that is what the June quarter results seem to be showing us. If the asset quality holds up^ this could be an area of very big large positive surprise.Intuitively^ one expects the NPL numbers to go up as we go later into the year^ given how slowly demand is coming back. It is anybody’s guess that borrowers will have problems down the road. So that stress is not visible. Maybe it is liquidity that is helping^ maybe it is the fact that domestic entrepreneurs are so used to lifting themselves up by the straps that they will find the resources and the ability to bounce back just as they did post DeMo and GST and this will cause some delays but in case of default will probably surprise the markets on the lower side.Let us see how that plays out. Within the EM framework^ I am reasonably positive on India. There might be some better markets out there but I am an India specialist and I would not be able to comment much on those markets .If you zoom out and think about it^ you should expect more credit losses. The question then arises where are those credit losses going to sit? Are they going to sit in NBFCs^ are they going to sit in MFIs or are they going to sit largely in PSU banks which have been pushing a lot of the Mudra loans or are they going to sit in the large private sector banks that have focussed on credit quality over the last three or four years.So the case I would make here is that the private sector banks are probably in a much better position than the aggregate banking sector and I would also make a case that NBFCs which have parentage or rating that will allow them access to funds are probably in a good place. Those are the two areas where I feel reasonably confident that the asset quality problem will not blow out of proportion and will be reasonably managed and the financials will be able to muddle through it.Now inherent to this statement of mine is that I am assuming there is no second big wave of Covid-19 which leads to much longer and much deeper downturn than what we can imagine right now. The central government and local administration in many places have clearly said the economy needs to continue to operate and most administrations are no longer in favour of continued lockdowns^ hoping that we can manage the health crisis without having to shutdown the economy and that is the assumption I am going with.Well yes^ some of these businesses have very enduring moats around them. It is not easy to be an exchange where the bulk of the volume of the commodity trades on your exchange and regulatorily you are required to trade on the exchange and these are virtual monopolies in some cases.Of course^ IndiaMart is not a regulated monopoly^ it is a monopoly because of how it has positioned itself. I do not want to comment on individual stocks per se as to what was good^ what is not but I would say is that if there is leadership in a business^ again going back to the four points that I mentioned. You have a good balance sheet and you think that the company is doing things that will continue to allow it to remain a market leader and therefore it can add products or services to the bouquet of products it sells that it already offers to its clients^ then I think it is in good shape.I am a big believer that leaders will become much stronger when we come out of this crisis because they are the ones who have the balance sheet^ they are the ones who have the customer connect and they are the ones who are winning all the market share and that applies to the names that you mentioned as much as it does to many other companies as well.Yes^ of course. I mean why not? Some of the government-run businesses or PSUs have fantastic franchises. They have great assets and they are reasonably well run. We suffer from the impression that PSU companies are slothful^ lethargic or they misuse capital. While that might be true in some cases^ in many cases it is not. In many cases^ the businesses are extremely well run. Of course^ their executives do not appear much in public and familiarity maybe less with the general investing public. But these are great businesses and they offer very good dividend yields. They also have great valuations and in the right hands^ these assets could be worth a lot more from a market perception point of view.So assuming that the government does go through with this and manage to privatise BPCL to start with^ there could be a huge amount of value unlocking that will come through in the PSUs.

Though demand for packaged foods and staples has shot up^ companies are unable to produce or deliver products to last-mile retail stores.“Ground realities are different than what the Centre is notifying.

24 Dec^ 2019,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/market-mavens-see-benchmark-indices-rising-15-in-2020/articleshow/72947629.cms,Economic Times,Market mavens see benchmark indices rising 15% in 2020,India’s key equity indices are likely to gain as much as 15 per cent in 2020 as investors bet on revival measures in the February budget and a recovery in the economy to bolster sentiment. The year is also likely to mark a shift in focus to broader market as investors become less risk-averse to mid- and smallcap stocks with a gradual recovery in the economy. The Sensex ended little changed at 41^642.66 points and the Nifty at 12^262.75 on Monday.An ET poll of 26 fund managers and heads of research at brokerages showed that 48 per cent of them see the benchmarks gaining as much as 15 per cent in the New Year while 29 per cent expect them to see more modest gains of around 10 per cent.“Primary manufacturing^ especially in auto and metal sectors^ is improving. Liquidity is far better now as banks are well capitalised. Rate transmission will happen faster and balance sheets of corporates are also much better now^” said S Krishna Kumar^ CIO^ Sundaram Mutual Fund. “Positive news will start flowing in the first quarter of next year and we expect the market to give a return of between 12 per cent and 15 per cent next year.”Gaurav Dua^ head of capital market strategy and investments at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas ^ expects an 8-10 per cent rise in the indices.“We expect the next year to be a year of recovery in the Indian economy. This recovery will drive earnings growth^ and lower provisioning by banks would boost earnings^” he said.About 31 per cent of the respondents see the Nifty trading at 12^400-12^500 by budget day^ February 1^ which implies a potential gain of 1-2 per cent until then. About 19 per cent see the Nifty at 12^200-12^400 by budget day while 13 per cent see the index at 12^000-12^200. Another 19 per cent see the Nifty at 12^500-12^700 by February 1 and 13 per cent see the index at 13^000 by that date.“The key events for 2020 will be the government’s balancing act in the budget^ some recovery in corporate earnings and continued momentum in global equity flows^” said Rajat Rajgarhia^ CEO^ Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities.The upcoming budget has to balance demands for tax measures to boost economic growth while taking deficit levels into account.“Corporate India’s PBT (profit before tax) is yet to show any growth while tax cuts are buoying net profit^” he said. “Markets will like the PBT to deliver double-digit growth^ although that has only remained in estimates for almost a decade.”Rajgarhia said the Nifty is richly valued and any double-digit return will depend entirely on an economic revival^ which can happen in the second half of the year at the earliest.While money managers and heads of research polled by ET showed that most expect modest to mid-double-digit returns in the upcoming year^ the focus is also likely to shift to the broader market where multiples have been suppressed for some time due to slowing growth. Experts said there is a need to correct the extreme polarisation of performance between the top 20 stocks and the broader markets.“The Nifty should trade in the 12^000-12^300 range in the run-up to the budget and after the budget^” said Shiv Diwan^ co-head^ Edelweiss Institutional Equities. “Assuming there are some sops to boost demand^ there could be a broader market rally^ with investors looking to take on some risk^ given compelling valuations.”The Sensex and Nifty have gained 15 per cent and 13 per cent^ respectively^ in 2019^ thanks to overseas investor inflows to the tune of Rs 99^000 crore — the most in a year since 2013. The government has announced several measures to engineer a turnaround in the economy^ including a corporate tax cut^ as growth has slowed to the lowest in more than six years.Unlike the Nifty and Sensex^ which are ending the year near highs^ mid and smallcaps are far from all-time peaks. On the BSE^ they are 20-30 per cent off their records.Money managers said the broader market is likely to rise significantly if the government announces measures to boost growth.These incentives are likely to come at the cost of loosening the fiscal deficit target from the budgeted 3.3 per cent for the ongoing financial year.About 83 per cent of polled market experts believe the government will ease the target. A 50 basis-point slippage is on the cards^ according to 50 per cent of polled respondents^ while 30 per cent expect the target to be eased by 30 basis points.As much as 74 per cent of those polled believe that an adverse reaction in the stock market is unlikely in the event of the government loosening the fiscal deficit target^ as they believe the market has priced in such an outcome.Banks^ fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)^ automobiles^ nonbanking financial companies (NBFCs) and metals are the top five sectors for 2020 while real estate^ infrastructure^ telecom and pharmaceutical companies are the ones to avoid^ experts said.RIL^ HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank ^ which have outperformed the benchmarks in 2019^ are favourites of money managers for 2020 as well. Those surveyed prefer Federal Bank^ HDFC Life Insurance Company and Britannia Industries from the midcap segment.
29 Apr^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/we-are-dipping-our-toes-into-health-and-hygiene-segment-marico-ceo/articleshow/75426708.cms,Economic Times,We are dipping our toes into health and hygiene segment: Marico CEO,Cost rationalisation will ensure that there is no job loss and that we continue to support some of the third party ecosystem. — Saugata Gupta^ MaricoThings have started improving. A lot of local permissions were needed. A lot of advisories and clarifications have come from the central government and the ministry of home affairs and things have started streamlining.Most of our factories are open. However^ with reduced labour force^ the supply chain is still getting settled. As I said^ things are improving and we believe that as and when things pan out and especially in places which are not impacted^ some kind of normalcy will return. But it will all differ from category to category. We expect significant changes in terms of shopping and consumption habits throughout the next financial year.In sum of the part (SOTP) breakdown^ there is enough demand for the food part but there are supply-chain issues. We believe things are slowly returning to normal. Consumers want to consume essential food and groceries. The premium part of the portfolio^ which is discretionary in nature^ forms a significantly smaller part of our portfolio. For example^ there would be reduced consumption in the male grooming or a skin care portfolio^ as we go.Having said that^ we are starting to explore some health and hygiene products. We have just launched a sanitizer. Some part of it is^ of course^ we are giving to the community and some of the Suraksha stores but we have started selling a limited quantity as well. We will be just wetting our feet in the health and hygiene segment and there could be opportunities in some new areas in food.In a post Covid world^ I see a significant change in the consumption basket. A certain part of the portfolio will be challenged and there are opportunities to be tapped in some other part of the portfolio.There’s a couple of things. There will be a significant movement into staples^ health and hygiene^ immunity and items of daily consumption. There will also be a shift to safety into known brands. Therefore leader brands will likely to take pole position and gain market share^ especially those with strong distribution and equity.There will also be a significant shift from out-of-home consumption to in-home consumption. Therefore^ even things like ready-to-eat^ ready-to-cook products are likely to be consumed far more. One of the things that happened during Covid-19 outbreak was that people with comorbidities or conditions like diabetes were more affected by the infection. So^ people are likely to take health and hygiene far more seriously.I see far less spending on things like eating out^ entertainment^ travel^ home improvement and autos. These are the sectors where consumption is likely to get impacted. There will be a significant opportunity at the bottom of the pyramid and downtrading will be more prevalent as people could have less disposable income in the immediate quarters post Covid outbreak. So^ pricing and providing value to the consumer is extremely important.Fortunately for us^ in this sector^ once things normalise^ the recovery will be quite significant. Also^ this sector has reasonably low capex. So I do not think that will be an issue.Having said that^ we have been extremely aggressive in terms of cutting extra expenditure because of Covid like those involving travel etc. So^ there are savings there. We are also looking to push innovations in the discretionary segment. As a company^ we are here to protect all jobs and support our third party vendors including suppliers^ distributors^ CNFA and therefore we are committed to ensuring that support continues.I believe that that is important to us for the long term sustainability of the country and long term sustainability of the organisation. So there is a balance and for our sector^ I do not think it is too difficult. We have cut down on out-of-home advertising^ some part of A&P^ some of the things we spend in trade like visibility. We have cut down on travel and there are enough opportunities for cost rationalization in this kind of a segment so that we can ensure that there is no loss of jobs and that we continue to support some of the third party ecosystem in terms of ensuring we pay them on time and therefore their cash situation and working capital is protected.We are making availability a big thrust area. The market share is protected. We are obviously conserving A&P significantly especially in the discretionary part of the portfolio and a lot of spends are for demand generation which is dependent on visibility^ merchandising and other things. We are conserving significant amount of cash in this quarter. As and when things normalise^ we should have the ammunition to spend and gain market share.Ramping up to 100% will take time. Having said that^ wherever there are issues^ we are looking to have alternate sourcing. Fortunately for us^ not much is imported and therefore there are no significant international supply chains^ which tend to get disrupted far more. A lot of it is locally procured and so we are more or less okay.But to get back into a 100% kind of a thing^ it will take some time after the lockdown gets relaxed. So^ the ramp up will be gradual because obviously it is not just raw material^ it is a question of supply chain trucks. Raw materials and logistics availability both go hand in hand. In any case^ we will continue to maintain social distancing and strict controls in our factory and therefore we will have to work with a lower percentage of people and rotating those people as and when things open up fully.FMCG is the category which is based on economic growth. It is based on increasing penetration and there could be some short term hiccups but I do not think there is anything concerning this industry. Obviously^ there would be some shifts in consumption. I believe market leaders with distribution networks^ strong brands and who have shown frugality and resilience in these times will emerge stronger.A lot of fringe players who have immediate working capital concerns^ weaker brand equity^ inability to invest in automation and digital and new ways of doing work^ might suffer in the short term. The opportunities are huge and therefore in a lot of categories^ you will see a V-shape recovery. In some categories^ there would be a longer road to recovery and there could be some permanent shifts in consumption pattern and the way you do shopping and whether in terms of channel choice or in terms of category choice. Those changes will be literally more permanent.As far as the FMCG sector is concerned^ there could be hiccups in the immediate term but I see a significant recovery of at least the market leaders and also players with strong brands^ strong distribution and strong balance sheets. There is no significant concern at all.

In June it temporarily suspended new work visas until the end of the year. On Monday^ it restricted federal agencies from hiring foreign workers including H-1B holders.“Most companies in the US^ especially IT companies^ are hiring locally now due to the H-1B visa issue^” said Sanjay R Shastry^ managing director of RGF Executive Search (India).The US is one of the biggest markets for Indian IT companies and pharmaceutical companies.Shastry said RGF is in the process of appointing an Indian expat from the US as the CTO of an Indian electric vehicle company.The government’s push to promote local manufacturing could help create many attractive opportunities for expats^ search firm executives said.Due to restrictions on international travel^ many expats are joining their new jobs in India remotely.While air travel is being opened up^ many expats don’t want their families to travel at this time when the pandemic is still raging in several parts of the world including India^ search executives said.“People are reluctant to relocate alone^” said Shiv Agrawal^ managing director of ABC Consultants.He said one executive that his firm placed as a project management leader at a real estate firm in India will join remotely from the Middle East.Navnit Singh^ managing director of Korn Ferry (India)^ too^ said many top executives are being placed remotely.Korn Ferry recently placed an expat from Europe as the head of a large retail FMCG in India.Expats want a share of the India pie as there is still immense demand for global leaders who have both experience in developed markets as well as large markets like India or China^ Singh said.How does the pandemic fit into calculations? Expat leaders eyeing desi roles don’t see it as a concern anymore^ Singh said. The best hospitals in India are comparable to those abroad and senior talent will have access to these^ he said.Some are even willing to take a pay cut to move back to their home country.“While there are better paying options abroad^ there are emotional reasons to coming back as well^” said Stanton Chase’s Chawla^ citing two CFOs living abroad willing to take a pay cut to come back.However^ those who are highly in demand globally^ like food scientists are not willing to take pay cuts.Pallavi Kathuria^ managing director of Egon Zehnder's India operations said that while there was no overall uptick in expats coming to India^ most who had joined since March were Indians^ and these were remote starts. Anecdotally^ all moves^ and not just to India^ will slow down at this time^ she said.

The order is effective till June 30.“We have started new production at the government-decided price. This would mean selling below the cost price^ but profit and business is secondary right now due to public interest^” said Godrej Consumer Products managing director Vivek Gambhir.A spokesperson for HUL said despite the adverse impact of a price reduction on the margins of its Lifebuoy brand sanitisers^ it would continue to ramp up production in national interest. “HUL will stand in support of the nation during this crisis^” the person said. The firm had already announced a 15% cut in sanitiser prices and will further bring it down.Reckitt Benckiser^ which makes the Dettol brand of sanitisers^ said the company would price its products as per the government mandated rates^ while ITC said it had already reduced the price of its Savlon brand sanitisers and rushing fresh stocks to the market.Be that as it may^ sanitisers of most of these leading brands continue to be in short supply^ which they attributed to a sudden surge in demand of the category which was only Rs 110 crore in size.Godrej has slashed prices of its 50 ml pack from Rs 75 to Rs 25^ while ITC has reduced the 55 ml pack price from ?77 to ?27. Dabur has corrected prices of its sanitiser sold online.Patanjali Ayurved is expected to roll out its own brand of sanitiers next week^ said spokesperson SK Tijarawala. “We believe in responding to consumer needs on a non-profit basis^” he said.Meanwhile^ India’s two largest online marketplaces^ Amazon and Flipkart^ have also asked sellers to cut prices of sanitisers and masks immediately or face blocks on their listings. However^ both items continued to retail at a premium on these ecommerce sites as of Sunday evening.Spokespersons for Amazon India and Flipkart said they have requested sellers to change prices to comply with the government order. “Taking cognizance of…the Janata Curfew^ and the fact that sellers may not have the means to reset the prices on Sunday^ we believe sellers may take more time to make these changes^” the Amazon spokesperson said.A Flipkart India spokesperson said it had put in place technology solutions to maintain checks and balances to ensure compliance. “Should there be instances where sellers breach these directives^ we have provisions in place for de-listing as applicable^” the person said.

It is also providing the reassurance of food security. Admittedly^ rural India is leading from the front with a much faster demand pickup compared with urban areas.The rural economy looks more promising at this point. In winters^ a favourable climate resulted in a bumper rabi crop. The monsoon rains have been good this season^ which means the forthcoming Kharif harvest too would be bountiful. Latest tractor sales data showed solid 12 per cent year-on-year growth in June^ after an 80 per cent contraction in April. Similarly^ the area sown under summer crops in June was double that of the same period last year. Fertiliser consumption grew sharply in April-June. All these are signs that the rural economy is back on track.Consumption is the bedrock of an economy^ and the rural sector is the biggest driver of that pillar of growth for India^ given the size of the rural population. Thus^ growth and development of rural economy is a key to overall growth and inclusive development of the nation.The economic package announced by the government^ a favourable start to the monsoon^ enhanced sowing activities^ higher MSP and aggressive use of the MGNREGS scheme as well as recent Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan have all helped engage rural India and bring the unemployment rate down. Increasing government procurement of food grains^ and that too at pretty high minimum support prices^ means most farmers have money to spend. Besides^ the government has also amendment the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) to promote freedom to farmer to produce^ hold^ move^ distribute^ supply and attract the private sector^ as well foreign direct investment^ into agriculture. Additionally^ a good portion of the multiple tranche of Atmanirbhar Bharat reforms is a mix of massive funds^ as well as structural reforms^ which aims to rejuvenate India’s rural ecosystem.The government intends to remove restrictions on API (agroprocessing industries) procurement to set up cold storage for agro-processing units. A rough estimates shows the central government has also scaled up spending on rural development programmes by 2.3 times in April-May against the same period last year. Moreover^ a renewed impetus on food processing^ livestock^ fisheries^ dairy^ warehousing and logistics and non-agricultural pursuits is expected to glide rural India into a promising future.If all things fall in place^ there could be a fundamental shift in India’s rural-urban dynamics and it will lead to overall demand improvement and give a fillip to the economy. Timely intervention by Central and state governments in this sector has resulted in good results.Besides good monsoon and government initiatives^ what has also helped rural India to emerge has been the return of migrant labourers^ who left the cities after the lockdown. They have become an additional shot the arm for the rural economy.From a stock investor’s perspective^ the rural India’s emergence may be a better investment theme for the near term. Among the key rural-facing sectors of the economy are fertilizer^ two-wheelers and tractors and FMCG. Investors may look at stocks such as Britannia^ Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals^ Coromandel International Dabur and Escorts^ and they offer prospects of delivering good returns in the foreseeable future.

Here are five reasons why,ET Intelligence Group: Fast moving consumer goods behemoth HUL is a must-have stock in any balanced portfolio. The Indian arm of the Anglo-Dutch consumer major Unilever has been favoured by the Street despite its expensive valuations. Here are the five factors that have been instrumental in HUL reigning as the most valuable FMCG company:1.The company spent over Rs 4^607 crore (12 per cent of its FY19 net sales) on its brands. This is equivalent to the revenues earned by Colgate Palmolive or GSK Consumer Healthcare in FY19. HUL has been one of the most successful in premiumising its brands like Surf^ Dove^ Lakme and Brooke Bond. Besides^ its investment in human resources has made it a talent ground for its parent Unilever and the Indian FMCG industry.HUL has time and again made acquisitions to respond to a threat or fill a gap in its portfolio. It acquired ayurvedic hair oil brand Indulekha^ GSK Consumer Healthcare for its malted food drink brands and Adityaa Milk to beef up its ice cream portfolio. Though not all its buyouts have been successful^ the strategy reflects the company’s response to take on competition.3.The 85-year-old company has kept pace with changing times and consumer preferences. It has innovated^ experimented and invested in new ideas and technologies. Despite that^ it has stuck to its core products in home care^ personal care^ foods & beverages. Its response to threats from Patanjali is an instance of its agility.4.HUL’s management unfailingly talks of its ‘strategic agenda of delivering consistent^ competitive^ profitable and responsible growth’ to the extent of it sounding cliched. But^ the company’s performance in revenue and net profit terms has remained representative of the stated agenda.The company’s revenues have grown at a five year compound annual growth rate of 6.2% to Rs 38^579 crore in FY19 - with net profit growing at a higher rate of 8.9% to Rs 6054 crore. Its operating profit margin has improved steadily from 17.4% in FY15 to 22.4% in FY19.Its stock has out-performed Sensex in seven out of the past ten calendar years and outperformed ET FMCG Index in five of the ten years. At a market cap of Rs 3.8 lakh crore^ it is the most valuable FMCG stock trading at 64 times of FY19 earnings. Its premium valuations have not prevented investors from chasing its resilient growth. Data from Bloomberg shows that only four of the 42 analysts tracking the stock have a sell recommendation on it.5.The company has several inherent advantages working in its favour — global pedigree^ long legacy of doing business in India and well-entrenched distribution system. Incidentally^ Patanjali^ the relatively new home-grown FMCG player^ has targeted to unsettle HUL from its numero uno position in the Indian consumer market by FY20. HUL seems prepared to take on the challenge.

What if I pass on the virus to my family? What can I do to protect myself? These are the questions many are asking in the new normal^ as the government reopens the economy amid rising cases of Covid-19 infections.A marketing executive at an FMCG firm has started taking along a spare set of clothes ever since the office reopened last week.Once back^ she changes in the building’s common staff bathroom before heading up to the apartment^ where family members keep a bucketful of water with disinfectant ready to soak the discarded clothes in.Only after a bath does she interact with family.A public-sector bank employee^ who has been taking a bus from Navi Mumbai to his office in SoBo every day^ has taken to wearing a Tee-shirt and a full-sleeved shirt^ along with gloves^ mask and a cap. He is taking no chances although it is sweltering outside – and the extra paraphernalia often leaves him feeling suffocated.For employees stepping out of the lockdown after more than two months^ it has become a strange new world – a world filled with anxiety^ say psychologists.Psychologist Geetanjali Kumar^ owner of Aakar Counseling and Wellness Centre in Delhi^ says there has been a near-doubling of queries (5-6 each day) from clients who are anxious about returning to work.Some^ she says^ border on paranoia or obsessive-compulsive disorder.Take^ for instance^ an employee in his mid-30s working for a Gurugram-based IT solutions company^ who did not sleep for two days after he was told that he needed to be back in office twice a week. Soon^ he stocked up on spray sanitisers^ gloves and was searching for a personal protective suit.Another client^ who is a banker^ narrated how her mother became terrified at the prospect of her regular office commutes^ fearing she would contract the infection. The mother is now undergoing sessions with Kumar.“When the lockdown was on^ we were initially in denial^ which changed into fear when we heard of the impact of the pandemic globally. Then came a point when we oscillated between acceptance and anger and understanding. Now^ there is a dilemma: it’s personal safety vs economic hazard^” Kumar says.There will be another circle of acceptance and anger since cases have spiked^ she adds.“People have no option but to go back to work^ because they know there’s a risk of losing their jobs^” she says.At a time like this^ organisations need to be prepared and communicate exactly what they have put in place for a sanitised and healthy work environment^ says Leena Chatterjee^ professor of organisational behaviour at IIM-Calcutta.Companies need to think out every possible scenario and how to deal with it. Alertness^ planning and good procedures to handle crises are crucial in soothing employee worries^ she says.Companies also say they are taking all possible steps to reassure staff.Axis Bank HR head Rajkamal Vempati says anxiety while returning to the workplace is normal^ and to allay that^ its HR team and managers are constantly having conversations with employees.The new office layouts and social distancing measures at work are also helping.“It’s comforting to them; we have seen employees sharing videos of the office with their family members^” says Vempati.Axis Bank^ whose branches were operational throughout the lockdown^ has brought in more employees in the Unlock 1.0 phase.At Deloitte^ where a minimal number of employees have returned to office^ chief talent officer SV Nathan says although the new norms and approvals sometimes take a toll on employees^ the organisation is taking all possible precautions.Learning experience platform EdCast^ which plans to get employees back by next month^ is proactively discussing how to allay their fears.“We are working on stringent protocols and have put together a back-to-work handbook for employees. They are free to call us up anytime about any concern they may have^” says Shweta Pathak^ head-HR and marketing - AMEA.“Indians are emotionally more resilient. There is a psychological sturdiness in our mindset that comes from preparedness for the worst^” says sociologist GK Karanth.Given the current economic crisis^ people returning to offices are also grateful that they still have jobs^ he says.“That keeps them going.”

The earlier lockdown was a pan India lockdown^ one lockdown for all. Now^ these lockdowns are very dynamic and fluid as they are happening in very select pockets. Now you do not know about the pockets or any unit of yours^ which would be impacted or not. Moreover^ some are for 7 days^ 10 days or 15 days and uncertainty is quite high^"" Kataria said.Another FMCG maker ITC too expects new lockdowns to create disruptions in terms of production and supply.""The lockdown announced in different states^ which is required to contain the increasing spread of the pandemic^ can cause temporary and localised disruptions to manufacturing and the supply chain^ said a ITC spokesperson.FMCG players had started to re-establish their supply chain in May and gradually ramped up as markets reopened^ which had created a momentum.""But now suddenly^ the second wave of lockdown has hit us^ it will definitely create a disturbance. We had hoped it to not have happened^"" Kataria said.When asked if there could be an impact on the company's July production^ he said^ ""By end of June^ (the company had reached) around 85 to 90 per cent production but July would be different because of several lockdowns happening.""He^ however^ said GCPL has a ""decent amount of inventory to take care of that"" disruption.Similarly^ the ITC spokesperson said the Kolkata-headquartered company is taking efforts to ensure adequate stock availability of its FMCG products in the market across these states.According to industry experts^ FMCG companies should be ready to handle the impact of such localised and intermittent lockdowns as these are likely to continue till there is a decline of the COVID-19 cases in the country.""FMCG companies should be prepared to manage these disruptions by closely watching the COVID-19 case trends across key markets and planning their stocking and production accordingly to address these uncertainties better^"" said EY Partner and National leader ( Consumer Products and Retail ) Pinakiranjan Mishra.Another aspect of these localised lockdowns is the impact on labour movement to factories.""We were going for local labour force as migrant labourers were not available. But unfortunately^ this intermediate lockdown has created a separate problem of its own^"" Kataria said^ adding while the labour shortage was high in May it had improved in June.According to a recent report from the data analytics firm Nielsen^ the FMCG sector has touched pre-COVID-19 level sales in June^ primarily helped by a rebound in rural consumption and sales from traditional channels.Both urban and rural sales are growing but the recovery/sales from the undeveloped semi-urban/rural quarters are much faster and traditional trade channels such as neighbourhood and kirana stores have scored over modern trade outlets as retail outlets and hypermarkets^ said Nielsen.Though the country is presently going through Unlock 2.0 phase but several state governments including Bihar^ Tamil Nadu^ West Bengal and Assam have imposed localised lockdowns.

That’s reversed the gains industry had made in June after the nationwide lockdown imposed in March was eased. Pune and Bengaluru are among the cities going under lockdown.If such intermittent closures keep getting extended by local administrations^ demand for the entire quarter could be impacted^ said executives across sectors. Operations and business plans are being thrown off kilter^ they added. “Sporadic lockdowns are disrupting operations and standard operating procedures^ which are different for different states^” said Varun Berry^ managing director of biscuits and confectionery giant Britannia Industries.Bengaluru announced a curfew from 8 pm on July 11 through the weekend — shops had to shut by 7 pm.This was ahead of a lockdown from July 14 to 22 as coronavirus cases rise. In Pune^ a two-phase lockdown has been imposed from July 14 to 23. In Uttar Pradesh^ all markets need to close during weekends^ the state government said on Sunday. In Bihar^ only 50% of non-essential shops are being allowed to open.“Weekend sales are down by 30-35%^ especially in UP^ Karnataka^ Punjab and Indore^ as markets are shut and there is no economic activity^” said Arvind Mediratta^ managing director of the India unit of German wholesale retail chain Metro Cash & Carry. “The one-off lockdowns are hurting the revival the industry had seen in June and first week of July. We are unable to plan inventories or promotions because different states are announcing different types of shutdowns.”Mobile phone retailers said sales in July have dropped 30-40% from June due to flattening of pent-up demand and mini lockdowns while supplies have improved. All India Mobile Retailers Association president Arvinder Khurana said the localised closures will hit the industry and there may not be any pent-up demand that will juice up the market when shops in these areas open up.While intermittent lockdowns cause disruptions in sales and distribution networks^ some have built up adequate stocks with channel partners. “The in-market operations are likely to be impacted on a day-to-day basis in these specific geographies^” said Godrej Consumer Products chief executive for India and Saarc region Sunil Kataria. “In the long run^ we expect sales would get normalised and we should be able to cater to a large portion of the demand.”Lockdowns have hit manufacturing units and supplies could be disrupted for certain items in Assam and Tamil Nadu^ Kataria said.“We have built up an inventory for most SKUs (stock keeping units) and do not foresee any issues in sales immediately^” he said. “However^ if lockdowns keep getting extended without an exemption to the FMCG industry^ we might start facing some challenges.”An ITC spokesperson said: “The lockdown announced in different states can cause temporary and localised disruptions to manufacturing and supply chain. However^ given ITC’s distribution capacity^ efforts have been made to ensure adequate stock availability across these states.”The auto industry estimates a 10% impact on sales in the cities currently under lockdown.“Whenever there is a lockdown of 7-10 days^ obviously sales get impacted^ customer sentiments get impacted^” said Tarun Garg^ director^ sales and marketing^ Hyundai Motor. “Bengaluru^ for instance^ was doing very well. But now we will lose opportunity for 8-10 days. It (lockdowns) is not in our control — we are focusing on what we can do.”The repeated reimposition of shutdowns could sap consumer confidence^ companies said.“There are some cities coming out of lockdown and at the same time new ones are getting added to the list^” said Naveen Soni^ senior vice president^ sales and service^ Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM). “There has been an impact on sales in places where lockdowns have been reimposed. It is a matter of concern.”In Chennai^ for instance^ where the lockdown has now been lifted^ consumers are hesitant to come to dealerships^ he said.While around 85% of stores are open across the country^ in the worst-affected areas such as Mumbai^ just 25% outlets are functioning^ said Vijay Babu^ vice president^ home appliances^ LG India.

So we are developing plans to become more aggressive online. We are also evaluating to launch new products in hygiene and health.""Gambhir also expects a ""polarisation"" in consumer buying patterns due to the 21-day lockdown as those avoiding store visits will buy bigger packs for convenience^ while those looking to cut their discretionary spends post crisis will buy small units and sachets.""Certainly^ you would see a market for more convenience products^ particularly sachets would become more prominent. At the same time^ there would be some segments^ which would be looking for greater value for money^"" Gambhir said.He further said^""In urban centres^ large packs would become more important as well^ because people would want to reduce the frequency of their visits to stores and some consumers fearing shortages^ may want to stock more in reserve. We would see both sachets and large packs gaining prominence.""When asked about the current status of production^ he said GCPL is facing shortage of manpower and supply chain due to bottlenecks in logistics and transportation and is working along with the government on that front.""At this stage^ the bottleneck is around logistics and transportation. Once there are adequate supplies available^ we can ramp up production gradually^"" he said. According to Gambhir^ the real challenge is ""to get the products in retail outlets. That is the big problem"".""The other parts of the supply chain will fall in place if we can fix the distribution bit. The government is working with various industry partners to help. We have seen improvements in last one week^"" he added."

Ajoy Misra earlier CEO retired in March but will be an advisor for a short period of time^ officials said.Speaking exclusively to ET^ Dsouza said he is reviewing the business structure to break hierarchy^ focus on action bias and ensure faster decision making to create a future ready organization. ""Simplification is a “mantra” that we are planning to drive across the organisation"" he said. D'Souza had to work on the integration plan at a time when employees have been asked to work from home.""These are unprecedented times and while I was a bit uncertain of how things would pan out while joining virtually^ what has helped is that I had spent some time with the business before I took over. Therefore^ I had met and knew the key members of the team and it was easy to get started.Tata Chemicals had de-merged its consumer product business into Tata Global Beverages to create a combined entity - Tata Consumer Products - with revenues of Rs 9099 crore and EBITDA of over Rs1^150 crore. India remains its largest business accounting for 61% of the overall sales followed by the US and UK at 18% and 12% each. Dsouza is currently integrating the businesses to unlock synergies and create a common execution platform^ he said.One of the key factors we are keeping in mind as we work through the integration is that the platforms that we build out^ whether in organization structure^ Go To Market or the Supply Chain are scalable and can be leveraged for any new category or business that we might want to bolt on in the future. he said.""I think this has been a crash course in learning how to deal with a high level of uncertainty in an extremely challenging environment. The safety and wellbeing of our people is a key priority for me and as a business we are doing everything possible to ensure that. Since we are in the foods and beverages space^ which is “essentials”^ we have also focused on getting our operations started up with all the requisite safety measures in place to ensure continued supply of products for our consumers"" he said.""There are significant opportunities for the company to move up the value chain into more value added and premium products in the food and beverage space.

""We are also creating profitable distributors of scale to expand our active reach in market"" he said.And while we have brought two businesses together the key is to now take an outside in view^ a “clean sheet” start and build a business for the future^ almost like building a start up.

The company has been exiting non-performing international operations in Russia^ Sri Lanka and China.Tata Group has a complex operating structure with 39 subsidiaries The management has been restructuring its operations^ and consolidation of subsidiaries is one of the agendas going ahead. ""The International beverages business is an integral part of Tata Consumer Products^ contributing to about 40% to the total today and continues to remain a key focus area. ""We have some significant pockets of strength in the international business^ and there have been some great innovations which to my mind can be leveraged much more broadly even in the Indian context.The diversification into multiple product categories from tea and coffee to salt and staples^ increases its opportunity in domestic addressable market by nearly three times. And over 90% revenues are from branded products with has a higher high growth potential^ say experts.IIFL^ a recent investor note^ said exposure to a largely-staple category and consumer up-stocking in international geographies^ makes Tata Consumer one of the best performers within FMCG universe during Jan-March quarter. ""We forecast overall sales growth of 8.4%^ driven by 15% growth in international coffee. International tea would also perform well^ due to consumers up-stocking during the lockdown^"" the report said.Tata Consumer is also building a digital platform across the value chain to leverage data and insights to driving traction on the topline and build efficiency at the back end. ""We are in various phases of building digital capabilities across^ including a digital platform for commodity buying^ enabling the entire supply chain from demand planning to procurement and embedding digital technology and decision making at the front-line distributors and salespeople.Apart from this^ we will also be focused on stepping up our innovation game. With the merger of the foods business^ we also have access to Tata Chemicals’ Innovation centre in Pune in addition to our earlier R&D capability and this will enable us to cross leverage know how and fast track new product development."" he said."

New launches like sanitisers and soaps from our personal hygiene range are showing early signs of good demand^"" Emami Director Harsha V Agarwal said.The Kolkata-based company has launched initiatives like loyalty programs in these markets.""We are also investing in digital marketing to connect with our rural consumers^"" said Agarwal.According to ITC^ in terms of food consumption^ it has been witnessing encouraging demand for Sunfeast biscuits^ Bingo! range of snacks and Yippee! noodles in the rural markets.Besides food^ health and wellness^ hygiene and immunity-boosting products are now at the forefront of consumer demand even in the rural markets^ it said.""Awareness amongst consumers on health and hygiene has got heightened across both urban and rural India. Hand hygiene and specifically handwashes have seen an exponential rise across India and penetration has increased significantly^"" an ITC spokesperson said.ITC has launched its hand sanitiser pack priced at just 50 paise to target these markets.Marico is also extending its network in rural areas.""At present^ sales from rural India contribute to about 31 per cent of our domestic sales^ and we reach approximately 58^000 villages through our stockist network.""As the rural demand continues to grow^ we aim to drive direct distribution and value to consumers^ as they will be the key growth drivers in rural markets^ while continuing to focus on increasing market share and maintaining volume growth which is independent of category growth^"" a Marico spokesperson said.Dabur is also investing to expand its rural coverage and expects to connect with 60^000 villages by the end of this fiscal.""We had invested ahead of the curve in building our rural footprint with our sub-stockist network going up significantly. This investment paid off as rural demand continued to grow ahead of urban for Dabur^"" Malhotra said^ adding its rural network has grown from 44^000 villages in March 2019 to a little over 52^000 villages in March 2020.""With the lockdown easing now^ we are restarting the expansion of our rural footprint and will take it up to 60^000 villages by the end of 2020-21^"" he added.However^ experts said the urban markets will bounce back once the situation normalises.""With the prediction of a normal monsoon^ the rural market should do well in the future. However the urban markets should bounce back once the COVID cases are under control in the urban markets^ lockdowns are eased and uncertainty levels reduce^"" EY Partner and National leader^ Consumer Products and Retail^ Pinakiranjan Mishra said.In April^ market insights firm Nielsen had slashed the growth forecast for FMCG sector by almost half to 5 to 6 per cent for 2020^ citing impact of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns."

13 Apr^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/consumer-biz-could-bounce-back-in-3-months-but-restaurant-business-to-take-longer-amit-burman/articleshow/75121251.cms,Economic Times,Consumer biz could bounce back in 3 months but restaurant business to take longer: Amit Burman,The government is doing the right thing. We have opened a few factories in Jammu and in Sahibabad and Pant Nagar and Baddi with limited capacity. Production of essential items is taking place. We are working with the government to sanitise kirana stores. We are starting with 10^000 stores to start with^ going up to 2 lakh stores. Other than sanitising^ social distancing will also happen. Consumption will start seeing an upside and hopefully we will go back to normal in about three months’ time.When I say three months^ I am trying to say that we will get at least 40-50% capacity in Dabur in terms of consumption. In terms of Lite Bite^ the restaurant business will take much much longer. We have started deliveries and that is doing quite well but it will take more than six months to get people back to restaurants.I believe that in all my companies^ the employee is the most valuable asset. We will continue to pay them and there will be no cut in jobs. I cannot say that we look forward to the government to help us in doing the same^ but my philosophy is we will definitely keep paying our workers^ our employees^ our front line staff because this is the time to help them.Tulsi drops^ Tulsi tablets business has been very good. Chyawanprash has seen a big jump in sales. We are also doing giloy tablets and Ashwagandha which is good for immunity. We are doing a lot of hand sanitizers from Jammu. That part of the business is doing well.It is going to take a little bit of time to bounce back. If there are 100 seats in a restaurant^ it has to be 50 seats now with social distancing. Families would be happy to come in if that kind of thing is maintained. I still feel it will take a little bit of time for people to be convinced about going back to restaurants. We have over 200 outlets. Hopefully^ even the airport ones will start running at 30-40% capacity within a month or so. We are getting ready.It has been challenging. There are two costs -- the cost of employees and the rental costs. We are not paying the rental costs now as everything is closed but we are paying the employee cost. It has been challenging because the revenue is zero as such or minimal. But we have to sustain. This is something which has never happened in my lifetime but the best thing is to just keep on going^ keep employees motivated^ keep moving forward because there is no looking back.Most of the landlords understand that as the lockdown is there^ no rent will be paid because we are not doing any business. Even when it opens up^ we are discussing with them about a revenue share basis and not on fixed rent. They are happy to look at that because we are a long-term player. I do not think any landlord or mall owner will want us to exit because if somebody does exit^ then it will probably take the mall or the landlord another six months to a year to get a new customer and I am sure they will not get a new person to come in at the same rental. We all have to bear the pain together. As business comes back to normal^ we will make revenues and I am sure they will get a good share.Yes^ we will have to look at that. In terms of Dabur^ we will make small packaging^ have to reduce our margins some bit to get the consumption up. You are right. The inflation will go up and everybody will have to take a hit.In the restaurant business^ QSRs should be flourishing more. Fine dining^ casual dining will take a little bit of a longer time to come up but it is a question of time. We will have to bear it together. But it is not that it is going to sustain. In the longer term^ normalcy should return and yes^ we have to cut some margins. We have to take a hit in the short term but for the long term it will be good for us.Things are really going up exponentially because people are staying home and are playing online poker a lot. We are just launching #poker which is two weeks away and that is going to be again an online platform for people to game. There will be a lot of free content on it. You can play free poker on it. Also^ learn how to play poker.We have already seen a surge of about 20% growth on a month-on-month for poker gaming and that is a huge opportunity right now.

The Indian stock market was no exception. S&P BSE Sensex dropped 22.8% while S&P BSE 200 index fell 23.2% during the month.Midcap and small cap indices had a sharper fall. S&P BSE Midcap index and S&P BSE Smallcap index declined by 27.4% and 29.6% respectively in March. Such a significant fall has made many stocks look very attractive.Healthcare^ FMCG and IT were among the sectors which weathered the market crash better. Healthcare index had a single-digit fall. Consumers doing panic buying and over-stocking led to better volumes for non-discretionary items. Rupee depreciation helped IT stocks. Cyclical sectors such as banks^ auto and real estate were hit most severely during the month.* On Total Return Basis** Source-BloombergFIIs rushed out of the door as there was higher risk perception globally. Stocks worth $8.4 billion were sold by FIIs. This is one of the highest monthly selling in recent years. Domestic institutions were buyers to the tune of $7.5 billion in March. In three months of 2020^ FIIs have sold $6.2 billion of India stocks while DIIs have bought equities worth $10.5 billion. Indian rupee depreciated during the month sharply by 4.8% against the US dollar.Internationally^ as cases related to Covid-19 soared many countries announced stimulus measures. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.5%^ bringing them close to zero. Many other countries also announced a number of monetary policies. Stock markets reacted negatively to the rate cut initially. Many nations also announced fiscal measures to contain the fallout as global demand has reduced and unemployment rose as a fallout of the epidemic. The US government announced a fiscal stimulus of $ 2 trillion^ about 10% of GDP. Many other countries also announced fiscal measures to fight the economic slowdown.Policymakers in India also responded to the crisis by several measures. A nationwide 21-day lockdown came in force starting 21st March. All economic activity barring essential services came to a halt. Transport services came to standstill^ leaving people stranded wherever they were.The RBI responded by cutting interest rates by 0.75%. Key interest rate benchmark repo rate stood at 4.4%^ lowest in recent history. CRR limit^ requirement of cash to be parked by banks with RBI^ was reduced by 1%^ boosting liquidity in the system. The RBI also announced LTRO (long term repo operations) of Rs 1 trillion encouraging banks to lend further.Government announced fiscal measures of Rs 1.7 trillion equivalent to 0.8% of GDP. Part of this money will go to the poor through bank accounts. The epidemic has moved from a health problem to economic and societal and also turned into a humanitarian crisis. There are many sections of society and business which will find the going hard. Poor^ small businesses^ self employed have been hurt deeply. Some businesses such as hotels^ airlines are at the frontline of the crisis.A one month lockdown hurts the GDP by 8% (one twelfth of year). Given that the lockdown is total (as compared to some other countries where parts of the economy are functioning) impact will be very hard for India. Current stimulus announced is inadequate. More stimulus will be needed for India to withstand the unprecedented shock economy has witnessed. Many who migrate from rural areas to work in urban factories have gone back to their villages. They may not return soon^ thus delaying the economic recovery even when the health crisis passes by.We remain very positive on equities at this point time. Investors should use this opportunity to deploy in equity if they don’t have enough exposure. Investors should continue with SIPs to take advantage of better valuations. Many companies will see a fall in profits in fiscal 2021. This is more than made up by a very sharp correction in stock prices^ S&P BSE Sensex was down more than 30% at one point.We believe the stocks we own have strong business and are led by competent management. They don’t have much leverage through debt. They will recover faster with a resilient business model. Many have proven themselves through trying situations earlier.India is likely to grow faster than many nations. Economy is dependent on domestic consumption and thus insulated from any global problems over the long term. While economic growth faces pressure in the near term^ better monsoon and measures to ease liquidity are likely to stimulate growth. While economic activity has halted in urban areas^ things are much better in rural areas. Rural India will bounce back sooner after the lockdown is lifted.(Atul Kumar is head-equities at Quantum Mutual Fund)
12 May^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/view-india-needs-to-accelerate-indigenous-covid-19-diagnostics-manufacturing/articleshow/75697966.cms,Economic Times,View: India needs to accelerate indigenous Covid-19 diagnostics manufacturing,In its drive to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus ^ the Government has further extended the lockdown from 4May till 17May^ 2020 with new guidelines that would open up the economy in a graded manner based on risk assessment. Earlier^ the districts were classified as hotspot/red^ orange^ and green zones based on cumulative cases and doubling rate.Now^ the districts are being designated on a multi-factorial classification that takes into consideration the incidence of cases^ doubling rates^ the extent of testing^ and surveillance feedback. States have also been requested to delineate and notify the containment and buffer zones in the red zone districts and undertake extensive surveillance for cases through monitoring of ILI/SARI cases in health facilities in the buffer zones. The list of zones is dynamic and will be revised weekly.Rapid and effective epidemiological testing is key to implementing a containment plan. Two types of tests are used to evaluate the impact of any infection on human populations: a direct identification of the infectious agent (e.g.^ viral RNA^ bacteria in body fluids etc.) and a measure of the host response (e.g.^ antibody tests also known technically as serology tests). In the case of COVID-19^ the viral RNA is detected by a test called RT-PCR or other innovative paper-based tests developed by the Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (IGIB) in India.Antibodies on the other hand are detectable either by a laboratory-based test called ELISA or a field based rapid test similar to the commonly used pregnancy test. An RT-PCR or equivalent test indicates the level of new infection occurring in a person^ hence it is a very important metric that policy makers need to track. Antibody tests on the other hand indicate the size of the population that has already been exposed to COVID-19 and gives policy makers a measure of the extent of spread and host immune responses.India did not have the capacity to manufacture testing kits with ruthless efficiency. As per ICMR^ India has evolved a robust COVID-19 testing regime in the last three months and is now in a position to conduct 1.25 lakh RT-PCR tests a day. While this indeed is phenomenal progress^ especially given the fact that we started from scratch^ nearly all COVID-19 tests done today in India use imported machines and most of the reagents^ which are hard to procure in the light of global demand.While India is strong in biopharmaceuticals sector and recognized as a global powerhouse^ its domestic capacity for diagnostics manufacturing has lagged behind. To address this gap^ NITI Aayog has launched a new initiative called Project CARD (Consortium for Affordable & Rapid Diagnostics ) which is a unique public-private-academic partnership enabled by the Government where a platform is provided by the NITI Aayog in close collaboration with the Department of Biotechnology to synchronize all stakeholders for a common^ urgent goal towards accelerating COVID-19 diagnostics in India.India’s public laboratories and research institutions have the expertise^ resources^ and collaborative networks to deliver working prototypes and process chemical ingredients. On the other hand^ several private sector entities have been devoting their energies to manufacture anti-body diagnostics. Project CARD provides a platform for scientists to collaborate in building R&D capabilities on an emergency basis.CARD will complement the National Biomedical Resource Indigenisation Consortium (N-BRIC)^ focused on building India’s capabilities in manufacturing reagents^ probes^ primers^ and other components needed for diagnostics. In a mission mode approach^ obstacles to scale-up of production of testing kits would be addressed^ regulatory processes streamlined and fast-tracked to ensure kits are ready for the market while meeting best-in-class standards.Not just healthcare companies^ but private entities in the telecom and FMCG sectors will be encouraged to make their supply chain and infrastructure available to deliver tests.Procurement procedures would also be simplified to ensure that there are no bottlenecks in the availability of testing facilities where there is a requirement. Also^ the private and public sectors will collaborate to set up test delivery and administering systems in COVID hotspots^ leveraging existing infrastructure^ augmented by new-age technology.As a first goal^ Project CARD will enable the manufacturing of at least 10 million rapid anti-body tests for COVID-19 by July 2020. In addition^ CARD will also support expansion of capacity in India for RT-PCR and other paper-based tests for COVID-19. Finally^ Project CARD aims to make India a diagnostic export powerhouse by the end of 2020.The pandemic is a clarion call to bring down the trust deficit^ and tear down walls that have prevented technology transfer^ stymied innovation and limited collaboration in critical sectors of India’s society and economy. CARD is the first step to sustainable partnerships that align the market with civic goals while encouraging the State to foster competition and innovation in other sectors and constituencies.

As the lockdown has hit operations of factories^ there is a supply vacuum which these counterfeiters are trying to use^ they said.The consumer goods companies are looking to rope in forensic investigators to monitor supply chain and also check integrity of some of their key suppliers^ as they are set to restart production. Companies are worried that the fake products would not only affect their short-term sales^ but also impact the goodwill among consumers.The companies have been collecting market intelligence in the past few weeks^ ahead of launching investigations.“While on-ground investigations are not possible in the current scenario^ along with our investigating agencies^ we are keeping an eye on the market for information on any counterfeiting or infringing activity of our brands during the Covid-19 period.

The exact impact on consumer demand is difficult to ascertain at this point^ the company said.Supply chains across the country have been hit since the middle of March at least.HUL sales plummeted in the last week of March compared to its daily run-rate^ said a spokesperson^ who pegged it at a low single-digit percentage value.“Availability of manpower for our factories^ distribution centres as well as for vehicles and trucks^ continues to be the biggest challenge^” the person said. “This continues to impact our wider supply chain partners too. Additionally^ due to restricted capacity at the main ports in India^ both for sea as well as air freight^ we are facing supply constraints for import of materials for which we do not have the possibility of a locally produced alternative.”A three-week lockdown imposed across the country on March 25 is scheduled to end on April 14 but some states have asked for it to be extended as they seek to control the outbreak.The local unit of the Anglo-Dutch company controls more than 10-12% of India’s fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) market and is seen as a proxy for consumer sentiment in the country. ET reported Wednesday that a sharp rise in the stock price this year helped HUL become one of the top 15 global consumer staple stocks by market capitalisation as a flight to safety has prompted investors to seek defensive bets. However^ the stock fell 3.5% to Rs 2^372.90 on the BSE Thursday.Consumers have been stocking up on groceries and staples as they fear supplies may run out. On the other hand^ makers of essentials and packaged food have seen big production cuts and supply disruptions after factories were closed in several places by law enforcement authorities. The latter also prevented the movement of trucks^ halting supplies of raw materials and finished goods. In towns where factories are still running^ police have restricted the movement of employees while many have refused to come to work for fear of catching the disease or have gone back home to their villages and towns.“We are hopeful that the authorities will take more steps to facilitate the inter and intra-state movement of trucks^ unlock capacity for movement of goods at sea and airports and ease restrictions on movement of people working in essential goods factories and distribution centres^” said the spokesperson.HUL^ which makes items that straddle the personal^ home and food segments^ said it would be important to meet demand from consumers for products that are critical under the current circumstances such as hand washes^ sanitisers^ floor cleaners and hygiene products.

With the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic manifesting into an economic and healthcare crisis globally^ the latest forecast marks a sharp downward revision from the growth estimate of 5.5 per cent reported in the January 2020 survey^ it said.The pandemic outbreak has severely impacted the economic activities as the country had to go through a lockdown to check spread of the virus. However^ the restrictions are being gradually eased.While addressing SBI Banking and Economics Conclave on Saturday^ RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the Indian economy has started showing signs of getting back to normalcy in response to the staggered easing of restrictions.""It is^ however^ still uncertain when supply chains will be restored fully; how long will it take for demand conditions to normalise; and what kind of durable effects the pandemic will leave behind on our potential growth^"" he said.In May^ the Reserve Bank had said the GDP growth during 2020-21 is likely to remain in the negative territory.Releasing details of the survey^ Ficci said the present round of 'Economic Outlook Survey' was conducted in June 2020 and drew responses from leading economists representing industry^ banking and financial services sector.""The latest round of Ficci's Economic Outlook Survey puts forth an annual median GDP growth forecast for 2020-21 at (-) 4.5 per cent - with a minimum and maximum growth estimate of (-) 6.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively for 2020-21^"" it said.As per the survey^ the quarterly median forecasts indicate GDP growth to contract by (-) 14.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2020-21^ with a minimum estimate of (-) 25 per cent and a maximum estimate of (-) 7.4 per cent.Economic activity-wise annual forecast indicated a median growth of 2.7 per cent for agriculture and allied activities for 2020-21.""Agriculture seems to be the only sector with a silver lining right now. There is an apparent upside as far as the performance of monsoon is concerned this year and the water reservoir levels in the country stand at good levels^"" the industry chamber said.According to the survey^ the rural sector supported by a steady agriculture performance and hopefully a contained number of COVID-19 cases will be a key demand generator for India this year.The survey further said that industry and services sector^ on the other hand^ are expected to contract by 11.4 per cent and 2.8 per cent^ respectively in 2020-21.Weak demand and subdued capacity utilisation rates were already manifesting into a drag on investments and the COVID-19 pandemic has further extended the timeline for recovery^ it said.Even though activity in sectors like consumer durables^ FMCG is gaining traction^ majority of the companies are still operating at low capacity utilisation rates. Labour availability and feeble demand remain as major issues for the companies^ it added.""Therefore^ fresh investments will be difficult to come by in the near to medium term. Also^ a significant change in consumption patterns is expected on back of uncertainty with regard to jobs and income losses^"" Ficci said.It noted that absence of demand stimulus^ a second wave of the pandemic and continuation of social distancing and quarantine measures will weigh heavy on growth prospects.""With demand and investment outlook muted^ robust government expenditure has been the only saviour. Nonetheless^ growth is likely to bottom out post the second quarter of current fiscal year^"" it said.According to the survery^ some of the stimulus measures are reaching to the ground - especially through the credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs and support through MGNREGA - which is positive.During the survey^ economists were asked to share their views on the fiscal stimulus package 2.0 and any additional measures that can be undertaken.Participants were of the view that government measures in stimulus focussed broadly on saving lives and undertaking deep structural reforms.""They^ therefore^ felt that while the quasi fiscal measures and structural reforms announced were undoubtedly steps in the right direction^ on ground implementation and results will take a long time to work through in the present environment^"" it added.A majority of economists believed that the government could have undertaken ""a more aggressive"" fiscal stance than what has been announced in the two packages combined.Participating economists also highlighted that the measures announced by both the Reserve Bank of India and government focussed largely on addressing supply side constraints with limited support for creation of demand.Ficci said the surely participants unanimously believed that the RBI would undertake further cuts in the repo rate going forward to minimise the economic shock and stabilise financial markets.Nonetheless^ a majority of the participants also opined that cutting interest rates would not pump economic growth given that the demand conditions have remained subdued from even before the COVID pandemic struck the economy.The fast-changing macroeconomic environment and deteriorating outlook for growth necessitated off-cycle meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI - first in March and then again in May 2020.The MPC decided to cumulatively cut the policy repo rate by 115 basis points over these two meetings^ resulting in a total policy rate reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019.Ficci said economists were asked to suggest ways with which India could best utilise the present opportunity to expand its presence in the global value chains.Efforts towards liberalisation of FDI policy must be complemented with improving infrastructure and ease of doing business in the country^ it added."

At the seventh economic conclave - organised by State Bank of India on Saturday^ there was an unanimity among the economists on laying greater thrust on decentralisation in policy-making in the future^ as a one size fits all approach may not work always.India at present has the third highest number of COVID-19 cases after the US and Brazil^ and has already lost over 22^000 people. ""Its very concerning that a lot of this discussion of the Aatmanirbhar (Bharat) package or other packages are not talking at all about what investments are taking place in the health sector. How much are we spending on testing^ basic information campaigns.""This is a health induced crisis^ you got to respond to that in order to respond to the economy^"" Rohini Pande^ who is associated with Yale University^ said. India has historically under-invested in health and the increase is not very much right now as well^ she said^ stressing that we need to recognise that for economic recovery^ humanitarian and health crisis are all interlinked.""To change this crisis to an opportunity^ let us invest in the health sector^"" SBI's chief economist S K Ghosh said^ suggesting a plan to build a 500-bed hospital in 250 districts at a cost of Rs 60^000 crore over the next two years. Pande said frontline health workers are not paid^ and we can immediately start paying them and expand their base^ which will lead to better case spotting and also contact tracing Arjun Jayadev with Azim Premji University said concerns on the health infrastructure affect the broader economy as well and pointed out that the animal spirits can only be rekindled once the fear of health shock goes away. ""Many migrant labourers may not want to return to the cities not just because they are not getting a good conducive environment to live^ but they are bothered about their health condition as well^"" he said.The Indian economy runs on two gears - one which have access to expensive private healthcare and the others who don't^ Jayadev said^ adding that universalisation of services should be a key theme while investing the money. ""You've this horrific situation where 5 lakh die of TB^ 1.5 lakh children die and we don't bat an eyelid^ except when the situation comes to us as COVID^"" he added.Rathin Roy in National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) suggested a radical change in output measurement where gains on agriculture^ health^ education and housing become the lead indicators of economic strength rather than focusing on automobile sales and FMCG good sales. Roy also proposed making a slum-free India as a policy objective by 2023.""It is obvious from the migrant labour problem^ it is obvious from the COVID situation that a slum free India (by) 2023 should be our objective. I do not see enough economists^ enough policymakers^ even mentioning a slum-free India^"" he said. All the economists also seemed to agree that the Reserve Bank of India will have to monetise a part of the fiscal deficit this year due to the extreme strain on government finances^ but did not offer a quantum or timeline."
20 Jun^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/lower-valuation-changed-consumer-preferences-covid-19-has-changed-the-private-equity-playbook/articleshow/76477970.cms,Economic Times,Lower valuation^ changed consumer preferences^ Covid-19 has changed the Private Equity playbook,The Covid-19 pandemic^ a stern and sensitive public health emergency has brought nearly all the countries around the globe to their knees. India^ amidst an ever-stretching lockdown and uncertainty surrounding its lifting due to the rising cases of infection along with countries all over the world^ have been brutally hit economically^ pushing the world towards recession. How individual countries respond to the effects of the virus in the coming weeks will be critical in influencing the trajectory of its economic status.Covid-19 is most certain to bring challenges for the private equity and M&A. At this time^ we may only speculate as to how Covid-19 has and will broadly affect the Private Equity ( PE ) space.The recent slump in the Indian economy has created uncertainties concerning PE investment in Indian companies. Most investors have used the 'wait and see' approach until they can be certain of some stability in the market while the others are being particularly cautious in their investment decisions. It is too soon to conclusively decide whether this crisis will lead to a buyer's market or a seller's market. However^ we believe that with the market being bearish and potential investors holding onto their cash^ the investors will eventually look to leverage on the sharp drop in valuations and get their hands on any asset on sale to seek a higher return on capital in the future.The crisis has significantly slowed down PE and M&A deals. We all know how the financial crisis in 2008 disrupted deal-making and it is now predicted that this crisis should also trigger new deals to a complete standstill^ at least for a short period. The fundamental of any deal making is the valuation of a company and the valuation is the ability to project future financials but at this time nobody can entirely project the long- term financials or even FY 21 figures in that case. Financial stability of the company and cash in hand with the investor is the biggest determinant for a deal. The investors having turned vigilant are looking to stabilize their portfolios^ whereas^ the sellers are hesitant to part with their assets given the steep drop in valuations. Such a mismatch between the expectations of the buyer and the seller will create a hindrance in deal making.It remains to be seen how quickly the PE space will recover from such market conditions.In order to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic the Government of India is continuously taking laudable measures.The Chinese investors have been on a buying spree and are beefing up their positions in the markets all over the world^ including India. However^ the Government of India in a bold decision vide its Press Note No. 3 dated April 17^ 2020 issued by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade and a subsequent amendment to the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules^ 2019 dated April 22^ 2020 issued by the Department of Economic Affairs^ notified changes to the foreign direct investment policy which aims to curb opportunistic acquisition/takeover due to the pandemic^ especially from China. The restriction was implemented soon after the People’s Bank of China (PBC) raised its stake inHousing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) from 0.8% to 1.01%. The restriction now puts all fresh funding from new investors as well as additional funding from a beneficial owner from India’s land border-sharing countries (China^ Bangladesh^ Pakistan^ Bhutan^ Nepal^ Myanmar^ and Afghanistan) under the approval route which will certainly barricade or at the very least impede any Indo-China deals.While such a restriction protects the Indian companies from opportunistic takeovers^ it may be noted that this policy change requiring blanket approval may not be reasonable as it may hamper the confidence of the Chinese investors in Indian companies which may affect the ease of doing business in India.Any transaction in the final stage of execution or negotiations is expected to continue but at a much slower pace and some postponed to a later date^ to be activated once the crisis subsides. The parties to the transaction will now look to amend their contract(s) to address the new risks in light of the present crisis leading to changes in various clauses^ for instance force majeure^ indemnity^ material adverse change^ long stop date^ etc.An exit option is the plan that is provided for in the investment document by an investor to liquidate its investment. Usually^ the idea for an exit plan is to optimize a good position^ rather than get out of a bad one. Exit Options come in various forms^ for instance^ IPOs^ third party sale^ merger^ secondary sale^ etc^ depending on the investment^ the general climate and the business.The exits will inevitably drop and the investors will look to extend the holding period on some of their investments^ as they would wait for the markets to recover. The investors won’t exit unless they can square off on the right price but there is reason to expect that as soon as the anxious market stabilizes^ exits could bounce back quicker than the exits coming out of the 2008 financial meltdown.The returns will take a hit in the short term as the investor's portfolio value is likely to drop considerably. Industry and trade dynamics are going to change and Indian companies are likely to undergo structural adjustments. PE players will need to reassess their portfolio and investment decisions to minimize risks and maximize returns. Having said that^ the market volatility can be troublesome for a while^ but the investors need not worry bearing in mind the long-term growth.The glorified Indian startup ecosystem is in turmoil due to disruption in the investment activities. The impact of Covid-19 on the PE space led to a ripple effect on the startups^ causing deals getting deferred and investments being paused. Indian startup companies receive a lot of investment from foreign investors including from China. Restrictions imposed by the Government of India on investment by Chinese investors in Indian companies (as explained above) could to some extent impact investments in startups.Likewise seed investments will get tougher as the investors will now be banking on stabilising their existing investments.The pandemic will test a lot of startups on various grounds and the ones which manage to survive this crisis will only emerge stronger and grow at greater heights.A silver lining amidst the challenging times is that a recession can lead to the greatest of innovations. The global financial crisis in 2008 gave birth to a few of the most successful startups like Flipkart^ Uber^ Slack^ Airbnb^ and WhatsApp. India being the second largest startup ecosystem in the world can expect a boost in innovations and the emergence of successful founders and their companies.Not all is negative about the outbreak as Covid-19 will change the way people look at how people do business. For instance^ India's largest IT firm - Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has planned to get rid of its 20-year-old operating model and consider a new model of work. TCS now plans to ask a majority of 75% of its employees globally to work from home by 2025. The paradigm shift in mindset of certain employers will drastically change the way people work.People who weren’t acquainted with the concept of video conferencing before the Covid-19 outbreak^ now most certainly are. Silicon Valley-based Zoom Video Communications is one such company that has soared as corporate offices^ schools^ universities^ organizations^ and millions across the world working from home have started using their product^ ballooning to more than 200 million users from 10 million users in just three months.Considering the long-term growth opportunity^ PE investors will now look to invest in Remote Management Companies ^ Software^ and IT companies that provide improved technological infrastructure for efficient work from home services.Streaming apps like Netflix Amazon Prime Video ^ and Hotstar have also seen a surge in the number of paid subscribers. It is expected that with the high rate of usage in the lockdown coupled with improved services with personalized content^ the video streaming industry is likely to be ingrained into the culture of the majority of people. Such companies may come out as winners after the crisis.Other sectors like Healthcare^ Pharmaceuticals^ E-Commerce^ Logistics^ FMCG^ and ed-tech will also become attractive to the PE investors.In addition to the severe health implications on people^ Covid-19 has had a significant impact on businesses and the economy as a whole. The implications of Covid-19 are changing by every passing day. The PE market though^ is not all shot to hell. Many investors are preparing to make investments at a lower valuation or seeking to invest in industries that have changed consumer preferences^ whilst others may focus on securing their existing investments in Indian companies.After taking initial steps to recoup and stabilize^ PE players can prepare for growth once the crisis is abated.(Purvi Kapadia^ Partner^ Rajani Associates and Jinay Shah^ Associate^ Rajani Associates.)

We are also extending this to cover Ayurveda outlets across India^” Malhotra said.The second phase of the exercise^ the Suraksha Circle^ will cover the entire supply chain of companies.Some cash-and-carry companies are also involved. Metro Cash & Carry India managing director Arvind Mediratta said: “The programme involves companies in the ecosystem helping to create safe places to shop. Apart from the other protocols^ this includes waste bins outside stores for disposal of masks and tissues.”A spokesperson for Walmart India said the company was keen to participate in the programme within the guidelines of foreign direct investment rules for cash and carry companies.The FMCG companies have been assigned states. The protocols include maintaining social distancing of 1.5 metres outside the shops as well as billing counters^ ensuring use of sanitisers or hand wash by consumers before entering the shops^ provision of masks to all staff and sanitisation of high-contact areas at least twice a day.

However^ there are at least three tried and tested players^ which have never let investors down since September 2010.An analysis by ETMarkets.com showed Fevicol-maker Pidilite Industries ^ pipe manufacturer Astral Poly Technik and FMCG major Hindustan Unilever HUL ) have delivered positive returns annually during past 10 years through the ups and downs of the market.Analysts are positive on these firms despite higher valuations.The superior return ratios make these players favourites among market participants. Data showed the average return on equity (ROE) of HUL^ Pidilite and Astral Poly stood at 95 per cent^ 27 per cent and 20 per cent^ respectively^ in last 10 years.Likewise^ the 10-year average return on capital employed (ROCE) stood at 127 per cent for HUL^ 34 per cent for Pidilite and 24 per cent for Astral.With a 5^091 per cent rally over last 10 years^ Astral Poly Technik outperformed the other two. HUL has gained 681 per cent for this period^ and Pidilite 887 per cent.These stocks are currently quoting high price-to-earnings ratios: 100 times for Astral Poly^ 73 for HUL and 84 for Pidilite against their 10-year averages of 55 times^ 46 times and 44 times^ respectively.“Astral will be able to deliver healthy revenue and earnings CAGR of 12.6 per cent and 20 per cent^ respectively^ over FY2020-FY2023E. A large addressable market^ strong balance sheet^ and robust growth levers justify the stock’s premium valuation^” brokerage Sharekhan said about Astral’s expensive valuation. The brokerage sees 11-13 per cent upside in the stock. Edelweiss Securities says Astral Poly enjoys significant premium over the industry average due to its ability to sustain growth momentum and create brands. The company is the undisputed leader in the most consumer-facing category of CPVC and brand Astral enjoys significant premium over others.Its entry into a higher consumer-facing category of adhesives under brand “Resi” further bolsters the valuation premium^ it said.Promoters had 55.74 per cent stake in Astral as of June 30. Mutual funds and FPIs held 8.34 per cent and 16.76 per cent.Pidilite has mixed rating currently. Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘sell’ recommendation. “The slowdown in real estate and construction activity was already hurting growth for adhesives^ which will see further deterioration post the Covid-19 disruption. The recovery is likely to be slower than consumer peers due to lower priority spends and increased cautiousness driving postponement of activity^” the brokerage said.It further said the margin outlook remains positive due to a fall in crude prices. However^ this has got priced in and it is unlikely to drive any earnings upgrade. “Given the downside risks to earnings from the disruption and delayed recovery^ valuations look unreasonable^” the brokerage said.Some analysts prefers to play the home improvement theme amid the ongoing work from home (WFH) scenario^Gurmeet Chadha^ Co-Founder & CEO^ Complete Circle Consultants^ told ETNOW that WFH and the new consumer environment world lead to more expenditure on home improvement.“Go for paint companies^ the likes of Polycab and Havells of the world^ the CPVC pipe makers^ something like Pidilite^ which is into adhesives and special chemicals and are clear market leaders with great ROEs. I would play the home improvement theme first and then look at debt-free companies with big return ratios^” he said.Promoters held 70.19 per cent stake in Pidilite as of June 30^ while mutual funds and foreign portfolio investors had 3.86 per cent and 11.17 per cent.In HUL^ promoters shareholding stood at 61.90 per cent while mutual funds had 4.37 per cent and FPIs 14.81 per cent^ as of June 30.HUL is among the top largecap ideas of Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Siddhartha Khemka^ Head of Retail Research^ Motilal Oswal said^ “The consumption space has consistently done well in the Covid environment.

Retailers and wholesalers including Metro Cash and Carry^ Walmart^ Lots Wholesale^ and MaxWholesale said sales of hot beverages such as tea^ coffee and hot chocolate have increased 30%-160% compared to the pre-coronavirus days.The April-June quarter normally record a significant jump in sales of cold beverages and ice-cream as daytime temperature touches 40 degrees Celsius in most parts of the country. However^ this year the scare of Covid-19 has led to an increase in the consumption of hot beverages. “Surprisingly^ we have witnessed growth in sales of hot beverages by more than 160% in 2020^” said Tanit Chearavanont^ managing director of Lots Wholesale Solutions^ a cash and carry chain owned by Thailand’s Siam Makro. It operates three stores in Delhi NCR region.Due to the Covid-19 outbreak^ consumers are cautious about their wellness and are focusing on building immunity^ Chearavanont said. A hot beverage with the presence of natural^ herbal ingredients and ayurvedic properties are in demand^ he said. Metro Cash and Carry^ a leading business-to-business wholesales with 27 distribution centres across the country^ has seen an uptake of 30-40% increase in the sale of hot beverages in April^ its MD and CEO Arvind Mediratta said.Nestle India^ maker of Nescafé brand of coffee^ is looking at making the regular hot coffee more interesting.

An incident management team (IMT) - a cross-functional steering committee - has been set up to lead multiple pillars for Covid-19 readiness^ and over 1^000 circle meetings (virtual meetings each manager has had with his or her team) have taken place to cover the last blue-collared employee on the shop floor.The company has mapped 40-50 top mission-critical roles^ with a plan of two levels down as substitutes to ensure business continues if any individual is unable to attend to a role. For its 140 ASMs^ the directive is in any given week — very few managers would travel in the market for business-critical work. Similarly^ for office support^ a small number of managers would come to office^ while a higher number of remaining managers would work from home. Managers are rotated between these three work locations on a weekly basis to ensure social distancing^ safety and business continuity. The standard operating procedures talk about what an ASM’s life would look like when he or she is in the market and what would it look like at home.“What’s happening today is unprecedented. The new set of protocols we have put in place will allow us to play a dual role of an employer as well as a provider of essential products like soaps and packaged foods to consumers^” said HUL executive director (HR) Anuradha Razdan. The company has plotted a large matrix classifying towns^ areas and micro-areas that are operating in line with government advisories. “With this matrix^ we ensure we continue to have contact with the trade and at the same time we minimise exposure and risk. For example^ for our field force^ there are guidelines and we make sure everyone has a shared understanding of this^” said Razdan.Considering that the situation is dynamic^ leaders are required to demonstrate quick decision-making. The day starts with a virtual standup meeting and ‘check-ins’ to ensure all feedback goes upwards and then seeps down to the people. Leaders are told to listen in and share in. Every team has these meetings^ preferably first thing in the day. “The objective is to create a virtual intimacy that will allow people to stay positive even through these very unprecedented times by keeping employees positive and bring transparency of communication^” said Razdan.At the top^ the management committee of HUL meets CMD Sanjiv Mehta where the discussion is around the health & safety of people^ business continuity^ long-term strategy & opportunities^ and how the company can keep the momentum going. Mehta is all set to hold his second virtual town hall^ something that he would otherwise address once every quarter.

The ratings firm plans a differential approach to entities who rely only on loans and those who rely on market debt instruments to fund their business.Economic slowdown has already take a toll on credit ratings of debt issuers with upgrades as well as downgrades worse than the five year average in FY'20.The Covid-19 crisis and the subsequent nationwide lockdown has resulted in a standstill of business operations across India. The fallout of this is that the credit profile of many entities across sectors has become vulnerable and this is bound to have credit implications that may vary from near-term to medium to long-term^ according to Icra.“Subsequent to our FY2020 ratings action^ the current Covid-19 pandemic triggered crisis has led to a widespread deterioration in the credit quality of India Inc. The credit challenges are overwhelming and would impact the credit profiles of a large number of entities across sectors in an unprecedented manner"" said Jitin Makkar^ head of credit policy^ Icra."" ICRA is reviewing its ratings and would be taking rating actions as warranted to reflect the breadth and the severity of this crisis.”Icra's review of its ratings approach will involve risk assessment both at the sector level as well as the entity level. At the sector level Icra will map them according to their risk and at the entity level^ they would be mapped according to their vulnerability.Icra said aviation^ gems &jewellery^ tourism & hotels^ microfinance institutions are among high risk sectors where firms could face severe business disruption over the immediate term and where the recovery is more likely to be prolonged. The medium risk sectors like automobile OEMS and auto-ancillaries^ construction^ consumer durables^ power^ face relatively lower degree of business disruptionsand credit risks. The low risk sectors include agri-products^ education^ FMCG^ telecom^ among others and are the ones that are unlikely to face material business disruption^ or a material increase in credit risks over the near term^ triggered solely by the COVID-19 crisis."" The above analysis would be an additional input for deciding upon the rating action"" said Makkar. "" The approach to review the ratings for entities whose borrowings are a mix of loans from banks or financial institutions as well as market instruments like NCDs and CPs; and for entities that have borrowings only from banks or other financial institutions are different"" he said."

Companies can avail the credit once the final product is sold to distributor or wholesaler. The wholesaler or the distributor could get the GST credit when they sell the product to the retailer.The problem now is^ in many cases^ the retailers are coming back and saying they are unable to sell the products as their shelf life has passed. This will lead to a situation where companies^ wholesalers and in some cases even retailers will have to reverse the input tax credit availed.“An additional GST cost on these perishable goods further adds financial trouble for these businesses - which already have a significant loss linked to spoilage of limited shelf life products. The industry has represented aggressively on the issue and is expecting relief from the government on this issue^” said Abhishek Jain^ Tax Partner ^ EY.Tax experts say that the situation gets even more complicated^ as some raw materials don’t fall under the perishable bracket and then there is the issue of input services^ so this would mean companies will have to proportionately calculate and reverse the input tax credit.Tax experts say that there could be two ways to deal with the situation.Either the goods are returned by the retailer back to the wholesaler and then to the manufacturer and credit is reversed (subject to timelines provided under the law)^ or a post sale price discount is given to compensate for losses.""But in such a situation^ there is a dispute as to whether GST already paid can be adjusted by the manufacturer or distributor. In cases where the goods are not sold or destroyed^ there is no option but to reverse the input credit. This is a major issue in FMCG and pharma sectors and more relevant in a Covid-19 scenario^"" said Pratik Jain^ Partner and National Leader - Indirect Tax at PwC India Many companies have also approached the government and sought a tweaking in the GST law temporarily due to Covid-19 pandemic Companies want the revenue department to allow GST to be charged on actual cash receipts as against when invoices are raised.This would mean that companies do end up paying GST on bad debts or in cases where goods are not sold to the final customer.Insiders point out that many tax officials have objected to this proposal as they think this could result in a revenue leakage for the government.The worry is in many cases vendor or supplier could claim GST credit but the company may never pay the corresponding tax."

Easier availability of finance has helped growth enquiries at car and two-wheeler dealers^ though sales volumes have remained low.Make-in-India has come as a shot in the arm for the chemical^ tyre and consumer durables sectors companies^ said Emkay Global.“Overall^ channel inventory levels across industries have come down since March - implying a few months of faster primary sales vis-à-vis retail sales in the recovery period as restocking happens^” it said.Latest high-frequency indicators suggest a slower recovery in July. Manufacturing PMI for July fell to 46 from 47.2 in June. A value below 50 suggests contraction.Some 38.80 crore GST e-way bills were generated in July compared with 43.40 crore in June. Power demand stayed weak^ falling 4.8 per cent in July year-on-year^ but it was still better than a 10.9 per cent YoY decline seen in June. Lagged indicators such as trade data^ inflation and credit growth also suggested the recovery could be slow.Motilal Oswal Securities said the corporate commentaries do indicate month-on-month improvement^ but the recent spurt in COVID-19 cases and various localised lockdowns did ‘muddy the waters’ a bit.Activity in some sectors in such agro-chemicals^ pharma^ FMCG staples^ paints^ steel^ gas and lubricants segments^ however^ seem to be back to pre-Covid-19 levels^ Emkay said.Data compiled from corporate database AceEquity suggests 399 companies saw 23.84 per cent YoY fall in net sales at Rs 13.77 lakh crore compared with Rs 18 lakh crore in the year-ago quarter. Even sequentially^ the decline was similar^ at 23 per cent^ from March quarters’ Rs 17.93 lakh crore.Profit growth^ however^ took a severe beat. Bottom lines of 399 firms fell 58.91 per cent to Rs 47^646 crore from Rs 1^15^967 crore in the year-ago quarter. The figure^ however^ improved sequentially by 3.69 per cent over March quarter’s Rs 45^947 crore.Another set of data showed that aggregate net profit of 47 Nifty50 index companies dropped 40 per cent in June quarter. A Bloomberg report suggested nearly two-thirds of the companies met or exceeded estimates.JM Financial said the beats-to-misses (BTM) ratio for its covered companies improved sequentially to 1.03 times in the June quarter^ 0.75 times in the past two quarters and 0.9 times in six .HDFC Securities’ institutional research desk expects September and December quarter earnings to be a better indicator of the underlying demand conditions and stress in the banking sector^ as supply chains settle down^ moratorium period ends and the festive season kicks inEmkay said all companies agreed the worst is behind for economic activity^ but the views on the pace of recovery differed over a mix of timeframes.ICICI Securities said Nifty earnings would grow at 19.4 per cent compounded annually over FY20- 22.

They are struggling to get it from ecommerce companies and modern retail. We have plenty of stock and at wholesale cost which is 5-8% below retail price.”Metro will deliver food essentials from its stores to customers through an intermediary who will bill the order transaction made on a smart kirana segment introduced on the Swiggy app. The app’s delivery agents will double up as carriers of Metro’s food and grocery products for last mile delivery. The deal was formalised after a month-long discussion.“Swiggy has a big fleet of drivers and an understanding of food business. Restaurants are shut and even delivery business is down by 80-90% from pre-Covid times. We wanted a partner who we could scale up with nationally^” said Mediratta.Hinting at more such partnerships^ he added^ “We will scale it up significantly and it won't be ultimately confined to one partner.” Currently^ only food essentials such as rice^ flour^ pulses^ sugar^ butter and frozen snacks comprise the Metro-Swiggy assortment. Non-food articles such as toiletries^ detergents and kitchen-ware will be added next.“We have to find products that can fit the bags of Swiggy’s delivery agents which otherwise carry restaurant orders^” said Mediratta.Metro^ the world’s fourth-largest retailer^ entered India nearly two decades ago but doesn’t sell products directly to consumers in India. It is an organised wholesaler that sells products through a membership model to kiranas^ local stores^ hotels and catering companies who have valid licenses.With the partnership with Swiggy^ Metro joins FMCG companies such as Marico and Britannia that have tied up with delivery apps to fulfill last mile delivery of essentials^ disrupted in the wake of Covid-19 lockdown.

Rajan^ who was Governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 2013 to 2016 but was denied a second term^ also called for a fresh look at the way GDP in India is calculated as he referred to research by Narendra Modi government's former chief economist Arvind Subramanian about overestimation of growth rate.""There are a variety of growth projections from the private sector analysts^ many of which are perhaps significantly below government projections and I think certainly the slowdown in the economy is something that is very worrisome^"" Rajan told CNBC TV18.India's economic growth has slowed to 6.8 per cent in 2018-19 - the slowest pace since 2014-15^ and various projections by private experts and the central bank estimate that the GDP growth in the current year will be less than government estimate of 7 per cent.In ominous signs that the slowdown may be deep^ the auto sector is facing its worst crisis in two decades with reports suggesting thousands of job losses in the automobile and ancillary industry^ real estate sector has huge unsold inventory^ while fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have reported a decline in volume growth.""You can hear businesses all around worrying and complaining out loud that they need some kind of stimulus^"" he said.Rajan said ""a fresh set of reforms"" are now needed to boost the economy and growth rate.""We need a fresh set of reforms informed by view on what we want India to be and I would love for that view to be articulated at the very top (that) here is the kind of economy that we want. One-off programs here and there don't amount to a comprehensive reform agenda for the economy^"" he said^ adding borrowing in international markets is not really a reform but a ""tactical action"".""What we really need is an understanding of how we are going to propel this country by the two or three percentage points greater growth that it needs and that needs fixing the immediate problems such as in the power sector^ such as in the non-bank financial sector and those need to be done yesterday^ not in the next six months^ it is very important that those be tackled immediately^"" he said.Rajan advocated for a new set of reforms to get the private sector to invest.""We need a new set of reforms^ which energise the private sector to invest. Sops^ stimulus of one kind or the other are not going to be that useful in the longer-term especially given the very tight fiscal situation that we have. Instead bold reforms^ well thought of^ not jumping off the cliff^ but really seriously thought out reforms in a variety of areas which energise the Indian people^ energise the Indian markets and energise Indian business.""This is what we need today and I really hope we put our best minds to think about this because absent that my sense is that we are in for not so good times^"" he said.The former governor also drew attention to former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian's research that GDP growth was overestimated by 2.5 per cent during 2011-12 and 2016-17.""I also think that we should pay attention to some of the arguments made by the former chief economist Arvind Subramanian that in fact we may be overestimating growth with some of the new GDP data and I would suggest - I have been saying this for some time - we need fresh look from an independent group of experts at the way we compute GDP and make sure that we are not in a sense having GDP numbers that mislead and cause the wrong kinds of policy actions^"" he said.On the ongoing global economic slowdown ^ Rajan said that in comparison to the 2008 financial crisis^ the banks are better levered across the globe.""History never repeats. So^ I think there is more leverage than there was in 2008 but it is not in the same places. Banks are less levered than they were then. On the other hand^ some corporate sectors^ certainly in the United States are more levered^ certainly in China are more levered and of course governments are more levered^"" he said. ""So^ leverage was the big factor in 2008^ it is different today. Not necessarily better^ but different.""Rajan said that he can't predict another big financial crash but if it comes^ it will be from different sources.""The big issue today is not so much the financial sector frenzy^ there is some but real (issue) is trade and global investments and the worries are that if we don't pay enough attention^ the old global order is going out of the window and there is nothing really to replace it to keep countries from doing things that serve their own interest rather than the global interest. So^ it is a different world^"" he said.Asked about 2008 meltdown repeating^ he said: ""Do I predict a big crash coming? I don't know but I do think that it is going to come from different sources and simply fixing the old problems is not going to prevent the new ones""."

This has been caused by a huge surge in demand for these items^ combined with low production in factories and severe transport bottlenecks due to the Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown.“Atta is in short supply^ followed by packaged groceries like instant noodles and biscuits. All FMCG firms are facing similar problems of supply and manufacturing^” said Mohit Kampani^ deputy MD and chief executive (hyper markets) at More Retail.Dal is seeing a shortage as about 75% of the mills in producing states like Madhya Pradesh^ Rajasthan and Maharashtra are closed. “The shortage is also because there is no means to transport the product^” Arvind Mediratta^ CEO of wholesaler Metro Cash & Carry India^ said.Nestle^ maker of Maggi noodles^ said it has no comments to offer. But the company had said last month that operations in some of its locations are scaled down or suspended. Other companies like Britannia^ ITC^ PepsiCo and Parle are also facing similar production problems. Factories of FMCG companies are running at 20-30% capacity because most labourers have moved back to their native towns and villages.In some states^ the government is not allowing the manufacture of packaged foods and beverages^ leading to scarcity of chips and other snacks. This is in spite of the fact that such foods are under essential categories according to the definition of food in the Food Safety and Standards Act^ 2006.“The directives of the Centre are not percolating down to all states. For instance^ PepsiCo’s plant in West Bengal is not operational. The other two plants are operating at 15% capacity because there is no labour. The existing inventory has a limited shelf life. Therefore^ supplies of packaged food are hit^” said a senior industry executive.Labour shortage is something that has hit all hard. Britannia MD Varun Berry toldlast week it was operating at 20-30% of its strength. Parle is currently at 25%. In many cases^ labourers are threatened with ostracisation by village heads if they go out^ leading the government to ask local administrations to appeal to villagers to allow workers to go to factories.“We have 14 plants across the country but only a few are operational^ with 10% production happening^” said Subhashis Basu^ COO of Indore-headquartered Prataap Snacks^ one of India’s leading snacks makers. Trucks^ he said^ are stuck with raw materials as well as finished goods. “Supply chain is a big problem. Although things are getting better^ this is not going to go away anytime soon^” he said. Biscuit makers like Parle said many of its distributors are not buying from it regularly^ while a large chunk does not have the manpower to send it to the kiranas. In many cases^ chain retailers are sending their own trucks directly to the factories to procure goods.

Excluding the merger of GSK Consumer Healthcare^ the segment saw drop of 4 per cent YoY.However^ some of the products were heavily affected by the lockdown. “Ice creams^ foods solutions and our vending businesses which are driven primarily by out of home consumption were massively impacted by the lockdown and closure of restaurants/eateries. Domestic Nutrition business performed well; immunity boosting Horlicks with added Zinc was launched in the quarter^” the company said in a statement.Home care and beauty & personal care segments of the company fell prey to Covid-19. The home care segment raked in Rs 3^392 crore for the company during the quarter^ down 2 per cent YoY and revenue from the beauty & personal care segment dropped 12 per cent to Rs 4^052 crore.The negative impact of adverse mix and higher Covid-related costs were deftly managed by dialing up savings and unlocking synergies of GSK-CH merger enabling HUL to sustain healthy EBITDA margins of 25%^ the company said.“We continued to remain competitive in our brand and marketing support spends in the quarter. Profit after tax (before exceptional item) at Rs 1^873 crores was up 7 per cent^ and profit after tax at Rs 1^881 crores increased by 7 per cent^” it said.“Our performance in the quarter has been resilient and reflective of the intrinsic strength of our portfolio^ agility in operations^ excellence in execution^ purpose-driven leadership and our strong balance sheet^” said Sanjiv Mehta^ Chairman and Managing Director^ HUL.“While constraints continue due to restrictions in several parts of the country and the near-term demand outlook remains uncertain^ we remain well positioned to drive competitive^ profitable and responsible growth.

Underlying domestic consumer business sales (excluding the impact of business combinations i.e. merger of GSK CH India with HUL) impacted by Covid disruptions led to a decline of 7 per cent in the quarter. On the operating front^ the company reported margin contraction (down by 117 bp YoY to 25.1 per cent)^ primarily on account of higher raw material costs and other expenses. The reported net profit grew by ~6 per cent YoY to Rs 1^897 crore due to lower taxes and higher other income^” said Amarjeet Maurya^ AVP - Mid Caps^ Angel Broking.The company declared dividend payout at the rate of Rs 9.50 per share.

The situation is likely to be worse next quarter^ it warned.The rating agency said excluding BFSI firms^ Indian Inc saw a 22 per cent drop in absolute earnings in March quarter of fiscal 2020. Aggregate revenues contracted 2.9 per cent while Ebitda margin contracted 30 bps to 18.8 per cent.Icra analysed financial performance of 184 companies that declared their results^ excluding BFSI firms. The agency said the impact on earnings is expected to be more pronounced during Q1FY21^ given the stringent lockdown.“The financial performance was primarily hurt by consumer and commodity-linked sectors^ both of which were impacted significantly as the pandemic started spreading rapidly. Despite some uptick in the initial months of the last quarter^ major consumer-oriented sectors such as FMCG^ consumer durables^ auto OEMs and ancillaries^ reported either decline or marginal growth in sales volumes^ weighed down by subdued consumer sentiments and increased wariness^” said Shamsher Dewan^ Vice President for Corporate Sector Ratings^ Icra.Commodity-linked sectors witnessed a 15 per cent contraction in revenues on a YoY basis on account of tepid realisations and subdued volumes. Income of consumer-oriented sectors contracted 9 per cent. Additionally^ demand from infrastructure and industrial segments was down^ with the existing weakness in the macroeconomic environment^ further aggravated by the pandemic outbreak^ the ratings agency said.Early indicators of consumer sentiment indicated a marginal recovery in May 2020 vis-à-vis April 2020^ as the lockdown restrictions started gradually easing^ although significantly lower than normal. For example^ data on movement of goods on National Highways increased upto three times April’s level but was still half of the pre-lockdown level.On the consumption front^ data for Q1FY221 suggest some recovery in demand towards the end of May 2020 as compared to April 2020^ with pickup in credit card spending^ food deliveries etc.However^ these may not be enough to push Indian corporate earnings. “In the immediate future^ India Inc will deliver an even weaker performance during Q1 given the aggravation in existing challenges. A major part of Q1 has seen negligible manufacturing^ infrastructure development and consumption activities^” Dewan said.

16 May^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/what-covid-19-crisis-means-for-indias-startup-funding-ecosystem-in-2020/articleshow/75771891.cms,Economic Times,What COVID-19 crisis means for India’s startup funding ecosystem in 2020,The year 2019 was a blockbuster one for startups in India^ drawing a record number of international investors. According to research firm Tracxn^ the startup community raised about $14.5 billion in funding – a significant jump from $10.6 billion in 2018. Data from Tracxn further reveals that 1^894 startups were founded last year^ out of which nearly 50% (887) received funding.Also in 2019^ nine Indian startups joined the Unicorn club and four got publically listed. OYO Rooms ^ Paytm and Udaan were among the startups to grab the most valuable deals^ followed e-commerce player Delhivery Naturally^ the expectations from 2020 were high^ if not even higher. Although the year started off well for startups and investors alike^ the outbreak of novel coronavirus or COVID-19 soon dampened their spirits. With many sectors coming to a near halt^ budding ventures began anticipating the worst – a severe liquidity crunch. As it turns out^ their fears were justified. Public markets are crashing and venture capital funds have become extremely cautious towards their spending. Deep-pocketed global investors^ too^ have decided to put off some large deals for the time being. But while the overall scenario looks grim right now^ let us see how the pandemic is impacting India’s startup funding scenario.Startup funding for March 2020 dropped by over 50% as compared to the previous month^ reveals data from Venture Intelligence . The startup data tracker reported that Indian startups managed to raise only $354 million across 34 deals^ down from $714 million secured in February across 46 deals. At $1.74 billion (across 126 deals)^ startups also saw a 22% year-on-year decline in investments for the first quarter of 2020. The numbers reflect a significant slowdown in funding activities^ primarily caused by a sluggish economy coupled with the ongoing nationwide lockdown.India’s revised FDI policy likely to hurt startup investments The Government of India has recently tweaked its Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy in a bid to limit “opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies” amidst the pandemic. As per the revised guidelines^ any investor of a nation that shares land borders with India will now require government approval for making any investment in India. While the move to curb hostile acquisitions is well-intended^ it can create an additional funding obstacle for home-grown startups.This is because China is one of the biggest stakeholders in the Indian startup ecosystem. Industry reports suggest that 18 out of 30 Unicorns in India are backed by Chinese investors and VCs^ including the likes of Tencent and Alibaba . China alone has made a total investment worth over $8 billion in Indian companies^ which outweighs all other neighbouring countries combined. Now that it has been mandated for all Chinese investors to get government nod^ larger funding rounds will likely take longer than usual to close. It is also expected that funding will dry up^ adding to the woes of startups that are already struggling with cash flow.The COVID-19 crisis has brought a change in startup investment patterns. Venture capital firms are shifting their focus from tech-centric startups to the ones operating in sectors such as FMCG^ online grocery delivery^ home entertainment etc. Apart from that^ startups in EdTech ^ FinTech and cyber security are witnessing an increasing user demand^ which in turn is luring investors. Also^ the government itself is offering Indian startups $130K to develop an encrypted video conferencing solution after that can work on multiple platforms.The pandemic has undoubtedly affected the startup funding scenario in India^ but it has also created new opportunities for startups that can adapt to the current environment. Some companies are already showing trend-defying growth^ which is giving a ray of hope to VCs and angel investors.While it is too early to gauge the long-term impact of coronavirus^ we can expect a positive turn towards the end of the year. However^ in order to achieve that^ a concerted effort is required from the government along with VCs and corporates.Apoorv Ranjan Sharma is Co-Founder and Managing Director^ 9Unicorns.

The reality is that this whole problem is not going away soon. We have to run our businesses and carry on with life and economic activity^ taking all the safety precautions.While there are challenges in this current situation because of the impact on the economic activity and certain sectors are very sharply impacted^ we do see a fair amount of opportunities for us^ particularly in our FMCG businesses . There is a lot of opportunity in the health^ wellness^ nutrition and hygiene space. Consumers are going to look for trusted brands and these are opportunities. Possible opportunities may emerge over time^ on account of the geopolitical situation also. One example was the German shoemaker intending to set pace in outsourcing from Agra. So^ there are going to be opportunities for sure and it is for us to be watchful and agile and make the best of the opportunities that fit into our capabilities and strategies.In terms of the package that is required^ if one wants to look at it in order of priority^ I would say we need to reach out to the most vulnerable section of the society on priority and that has happened right at the beginning and it is continuing to do so.It is heartening to see a lot of civil society members and corporates coming out in a big way to support the most vulnerable sections of society because this is a serious challenge for millions of people who earn their livelihood daily. That is most important. We must all remember that ultimately businesses do not flourish in societies that are under distress or tension. It is in our interest to support that. So^ that is the most important.The second is that the largest stimulus that can happen is actually getting back to work and how to adjust to the new normal. The longer we take to adjusting to the new normal^ the bigger is the amount of stress and the larger amount of resources will be required to pull it out. In order to get back to the new normal and get back economic activity in the new normal^ first the government has to tackle the issues of liquidity and that is a first step.We hope that going forward^ we will see some measures to boost consumption. Some of the reforms that have been done for agriculture consists of moves that have been spoken about in the past and they can have a transformative impact on the agriculture sector over a period of time. But yes^ those measures are not going to give impact immediately but medium term^ these augur well for the economy.As far as FMCG is concerned^ it is slowly getting back to normal demand levels. It varies across categories. We are seeing good demand for staples pieces that can be classified as discretionary.Yes there is some amount of stress there but at an aggregate level^ as far as foods and personal care is concerned^ at an aggregate level^ it is coming back to a reasonable level. Over time^ as capacities scale up and as distribution improves and logistics improves further and markets fully open up^ there is opportunity to go up further. There are segments like education and stationery which have been severely impacted for the moment because the sessions of the schools have changed and the business is heavily indexed to the school sessions. But ultimately^ children will have to go back to school and students will have to go through education. I would say that it is more a timing issue than anything else.On the other extreme^ we have hotels which are very adversely impacted. Also hotels are supporting quarantine facilities or dealing with helping some stranded guests. Most of our hotels are not operational right now. This is in line with the guidelines of the government. Then we have agriculture also. It is slowly getting back to normal and this is indexed to food consumption^ paper and paper board consumption. Somewhere^ a little bit is still lagging because once the economy fully opens up^ we will hopefully see more demand for paper boards and packaging coming in.I believe that some of the trends that were already active pre-Covid^ will accentuate post Covid crisis. For example^ we had already become aware of the challenge of sustainability. Civil society was witnessing numerous extreme weather events over time. We were experiencing the shortages of water in cities also. Post Covid^ people have seen how nature has healed itself. So^ I think civil society and consumers are going to demand from everybody and every enterprise demonstrates behaviour that nourishes the environment.We have for the first time seen what the environment should be. So^ that is one trend. The second is I do see consumers looking for trusted brands^ consumers putting a lot of attention and resources behind sanitation^ health^ hygiene^ nutrition. The trend towards organics will accentuate.Digital was an undercurrent earlier. It was on a fast trajectory. It is going to go up even more sharply and digital is going to become an even greater piece of our lives -- be it for management or for backend supply chain or consumer engagement or even consumers in their day to day activities.I also see that the neighbourhood shop kirana is going to be in focus and get a lot of respect considering that that proved to be very critical in these difficult times. Of course^ online transactions will continue to grow as things normalise because at least for sometime people may prefer to step out in a more limited sense and will realise the convenience of online.10 years back^ it was 60% tobacco and 40% non-tobacco. Today it is actually the other way around. It is about 60% non-tobacco. It is not that we are shrinking tobacco^ it is just that the investments we are making today. The headroom for growth is much higher in our other segments. So^ we expect other segments to grow much faster and certainly the figure will go more and more in favour of our non-tobacco businesses.Today 80% of my capital employed is in non-tobacco businesses^ 90% of my employees are not in non-tobacco businesses that reflect the kind of investments we are making in the non-tobacco segments. In all these segments^ I believe there is huge headroom to grow notwithstanding that there are certain challenges in the short term^ particularly with respect to the hospitality segment. Going forward^ once we are over this difficult phase^ even that segment offers opportunities because there is a lot of outbound tourism from India. I suspect as a trend^ there will be even greater focus for inbound tourism.Our approach in hotels so far has been to build a footprint which is largely done. There are some projects that are work in progress and our focus right now is on asset right strategy. Given the positioning we have^ we will be able to expand our footprint quite a lot even in those segments besides FMCG over a period of time.The biggest challenge that the tobacco segment faces in India is the threat of the illegal segment. One in four cigarettes in India is an illicit cigarette and as taxes have been rising^ the illicit industry has been rising. Over a period of five-six years^ the taxes on cigarettes tripled and at a CAGR level^ the tax rate grew at about over 15% whereas the revenue growth was between 4% and 5%.There was stability in 2018-19 and revenues grew at about 9%. It was simply because the legal industry was able to claw back over a period of time. I see that as the biggest challenge as far as the cigarette industry is concerned and the data point that is available will hopefully convince and will be taken on board. We will see if there is stability in the tax regime.The industry can recover because there is a huge amount of illegal products in the country and Ficci estimates the revenue loss on account of that to be Rs 13^000 crore. Even the farmers lose a lot because the smuggled or illicit cigarettes do not actually use the tobacco that is made in India. Indian manufacturers also lose and so nobody gains in the process. This to my mind is the biggest challenge that the industry faces.I wish I had an answer. I believe that the PE multiples are much lower than what they should be. I understand that there are concerns from a taxation perspective. There are anxieties on that respect and every time an event comes which could lead to tax change^ an anxiety develops. There have also been some pressures on account of views on ESG.I agree that investors should look at free cash flows that the company is generating and I would say the performance was quite resilient despite a very difficult period in the last five-six years. Taxation has more than tripled in the last few years but we have also been part of the larger macro ecosystem and we have been impacted with that. There have been many events that we have gone through besides taxation and yet performance held on a steady basis^ continuing to improve in periods of stability. We actually went into double digit bottom line growth.We have demonstrated resilience. We have free cash flows. Given that a lot of our investments in new businesses in this current phase is getting concluded and because we were building the foundation^ the incremental investments in future will not be as much. Therefore^ the board has taken a view on the dividend distribution policy.The dividends are going to be between 80% and 85% and so from a dividend yield perspective^ it is a big positive.The FMCG segment which is a segment which typically draws very high multiples in India^ now we have got scale there. What people argue is on the bottom line but we must keep in mind that our bottom line includes the cost of gestation of brand building and within our portfolio^ we have many small and nascent businesses which we are incubating for the future.We have taken a view from a food perspective that we wish to put in place world class infrastructure which will ensure that our product safety^ hygiene standards are top of the line and to some degree^ we have invested ahead of time there. It provides an enormous headroom to grow and secondly is the manner in which we have invested.We have also created structural advantages in the supply chain because foods is a very freight intensive business. It is about proximity to the markets^ it is about freshness^ it is about producing layers in the distribution chain so that our cost of distribution reduces and as our relatively older businesses are becoming bigger^ you are seeing the impact on our bottom line. Between 2017 and 2019^ we have increased by 2.6 times and if you look at this year also^ YTD EBITDA has moved by nearly 2 percentage points.I also would like to keep in mind all other businesses which are older for us^ where we have demonstrated capability to provide best in class profitability or at least in some businesses^ aligned with the best in the industry. You will also notice that we have built it patiently. We have built the foundation and then got the results and it is the same process here because we are here for the long term^ we are here to build a large economic engine for ITC and over time^ I am sure the results will be more than visible.Industry benchmarks will take some time because in our portfolio itself^ there are many businesses which are small and have to be incubated. In the last two-three years itself^ there are a number of new categories we have entered into. We have gone to frozen snacks^ floor cleaners^ coffee^ chocolates^ dairy beverages as well as fresh dairy.There are many segments that we have added to our portfolio. Each one of them will take some time to mature and as you rightly said^ the investments in brand building and gestating cost of capacity which is ahead of demand^ is a certain thing that will have to be factored in.But businesses which are relatively larger and which we started early in our journey are providing good financial metric and within three years^ the impact will be seen because the way we are making progress^ I do not see any reason why the trend will not be continued. Margin should be improving year on year for sure.This topic has been raised often but you have to really answer the question by simply looking at which situation is going to create greater value. There are a few things that are advantageous when we are combined as an organisation. One is that we are able to leverage a large and robust distribution and logistics highway and these are all high cost elements in any company’s operations. Splitting it will mean duplication of resources.Second^ what is the value that you are creating out of the synergy of being together? You spoke about tobacco and FMCG. You could even argue about hotels but there is a lot of value that is created by our hotels business and foods business interacting very closely.In ITC Masterchef’s frozen snacks that we launched^ all the seasoning and the textures etc were recommended and tested by our chefs in the hotels. Today^ we are deriving far more value by being together than being separate. In fact^ about two^ three years back^ when Michael Porter was in India^ he gave the Porter Prize to us for corporate governance and integration. The integration piece is about how you create synergy out of diversity.That is something which has helped us with grants and has helped us come out with innovative solutions. We are able to cross pollinate ideas from one business to the other. Some of the principles that we have used in our traditional businesses^ we have used for example^ in creating Aashirvaad Atta which is the market leader today.All this happens when people interact closely^ have an opportunity to look at things together and debate it so that is where cross pollination of ideas comes. It is really about how much synergy you create. At some point of time in future^ when each of these businesses are mature^ then this whole thing can be revisited. But in today’s context^ we are creating a lot of value through synergy.I am really talking about the synergy that exists from a FMCG perspective and the other businesses of course^ are already mature.As I said^ since our investment requirements are going to be smaller going forward^ we have already announced in our dividend policy that the payout ratio will be much higher. As far as our portfolio business is concerned^ In today’s hyper competitive world^ it is very important for any company to play to its strengths and the portfolio that we have today is one where our capabilities and institutional strengths are really leveraged well.This portfolio aligns well with the opportunities in the marketplace^ whether it is FMCG^ whether it is agriculture^ whether is paper board and packaging and over a period of time even hotels. So all these businesses have got huge headroom to grow and we will be investing to strengthen and grow these businesses.In hotels^ we are moving to an asset right model. After we finish the current projects in the pipeline^ there will be much lower levels of investments. It is more working with other hotel owners and helping them run their operations with the portfolio of brands that ITC has got. That is what the focus will be. We are going to focus on these verticals. There is a huge room to grow there and we have a very huge aspiration in FMCG.The first step is that we have got into a number of categories in the recent past. We are going to scale up these categories^ make them market leaders and once these categories scale up^ we will explore other areas because we want to make the FMCG space really big.We have the institutional capabilities^ if you look at our foods business^ the strength of agriculture^ the strength of cuisine^ the strength of distribution^ the strength of R&D^ the strength of packaging innovation^ all the elements are together and that is where we will focus.Well that I do not know but all I can say is that our non tobacco businesses will grow at a much higher rate. There is a base effect also that you must factor in. But the rate of growth in the non tobacco segment will certainly be much faster.ITC’s credo is nation first^ Sab Saath Badhein. I would like to live this philosophy in whatever business we do and that is the DNA of the company. I was very happy to hear the honourable prime minister speaking about self reliance and the finance minister also clarified that it is not about isolation but it is about a stronger^ more resilient India. That is the philosophy with which we have always operated and that is manifest in our investments in trying to create world class Indian brands.If you look at Aashirvaad Atta^ there is the wheat value chain behind it. For us^ it is not just about procurement it is also about working with the millions of farmers so that their productivity and quality and realisations improve.When we started juices^ we said if we have to create value^ we must use fruits from India. So^ our is the only brand that uses 100% Indian fruits. Look at the example of agarbatti. We import a lot of these bamboo sticks. India cannot be strong if all these things are going to be imported because a lot of livelihoods are created out in the farm fields^ agro forestry and agriculture as compared to simply in the factory.Two years back^ we started the work with the certain governments and have started the plantation of a variety of bamboo that is required for agarbatti sticks^ next year we will be harvesting the first crop. This is the way we should be conducting business so that we are contributing to building inclusive value chains^ creating livelihoods. Today^ e-chaupals empower four million farmers. This is what ITC stands for^ that is what ITC would like to be remembered for and as an employee of ITC^ that is what I would like to be remembered for.That is the philosophy and the manner in which we conduct our business. There could be some opportunities in adjacent businesses but what is core to us is this whole philosophy of being able to contribute to the society.The toughest moment was when the lockdown was announced and you suddenly found everything unsettled. At that moment^ one could not imagine how we will realign and manage in such a situation. The happiest moment was the next day when we all realised that we can actually do it.

28 Mar^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/coronavirus-the-biggest-challenge-right-now-is-business-continuity/articleshow/74857196.cms,Economic Times,Coronavirus: The biggest challenge right now is business continuity,“Black Swan event. That’s what it is. The suddenness and severity of the Covid-19 slowdown is unprecedented^” said Alok Vaish^ CFO^ Jubilant Life sciences ^ referencing finance guru Nicholas Tayeb’s cult book that outlines the extreme impact of rare and unpredictable events.As the Covid-19 outbreak hits companies hard^ CFOs like Vaish are bracing for what many are referring to as the toughest phase in their careers.Suddenly^ there’s war at every front and CFOs find themselves in the middle of every situation: whether it’s collating information from supply chain and manufacturing units or managing March-end compliance pressure or overseeing treasury operations or limiting forex volatility damage to evaluating cash flows hit hard by low collections. They are having lengthy chats with edgy investors^ reworking revenue and cost projections and handling implications from falling share price at the same time.And the biggest problem haunting them is that their business continuity plans (BCPs) are being tested and reworked every day given. “For any organisation^ the biggest challenge right now is business continuity. A company like PVR^ which garners revenue in the range of Rs 300 crore per month^ is staring at a situation where revenue is nil because all theatres are shut. So the question is how to sustain the fixed cost. Nobody knows how long it will last and how soon India will bounce back. So CFOs will have to play a very active role and work with business teams to figure out business continuity plans^” said Nitin Sood^ CFO^ PVR.Even well drawn out BCPs are suddenly in deep water. “I have 18 factories across India. The BCP was to shift manufacturing from one zone to another^ if there is a problem. But the BCP has gone for a toss now that all 24 factories are under lockdown and staff is sitting at home.” said CFO of a leading FMCG company^ who is not allowed to speak to media.CFOs in sectors that have been heavily hit like travel^ tourism and hospitality have been working late hours and are under lot of stress. “I am taking reports of all 61 operational hotels on an hourly basis. The past few weeks have been very stressful. From March 10 onwards^ we started reducing our costs. But^ they can’t be made zero. We still have to maintain operating hotels and that involves some costs. We don’t know when the situation will improve. We are trying to keep our nose above the water. The biggest challenge is with the hotels that have got loans and debt^” Said Amit Jaiswal^ CFO^ Royal Orchid Hotels.And with multiple situations demanding urgent attention^ working from home requires greater efforts at managing time too. “There is a lot of anxiety amongst employees^ customers^ investors^ so I have been on calls with all of them and telling them it’s a phase and that it will pass and hopefully we will all come out stronger^ having gone through this adversity. It is hard to manage time. When you are in office^ you are able to get things done faster by getting together with all the people. Decision making is faster. Here^ we are leveraging mails^ calls and videoconferencing. We are still able to take decisions at the right time^ but it involves a lot more effort to get everyone together^” said Jubilant Lifesciences’ Vaish. “The foremost priority is the safety of our employees and their well being. We can cope up with business challenges but livelihood and well being of our staff is of utmost importance in the current market^” added Sanjay Agarwal^ CFO^ Jyothy Labs Given how quickly the slowdown swooped on corporate India^ the finance department has had to make quick adaptations. A lot of CFOs have had to digitise processes quickly. “We had to set up an end-to-end process for invoicing and payments almost overnight^” says CFO of a fintech startup.While the bean counters work the numbers^ they are also working closely with CEOs to optimise future planning. “This is the time to sit back and re-think internally about consolidation^ geographies and what can be improved. We are also looking inward as a company^” said Venkat K Narayana – CEO^ Prestige Group Experts say companies with short payment cycles and high debt levels are facing big challenges.In capital intensive sectors like real estate^ the foremost requirement would be of capital. “So^ the focus is to ensure that there is less stress on the cash flow cycle and re-initiate raising funds^ once things are back to normal. At this juncture^ it’s too early to ascertain the impact^ but we have kept an eye on the situation and will act according to changing environment^” said Kuldip Chawla^ CFO^ Puravankara.Uncertainty over the lockdowns has made it impossible to predict business impact so multiple business scenarios and models are being prepared. It is time for some tough talk internally as well^ and expenses have to be slashed. “As a CFO^ you have to be conservative and tell the business teams to defer and suspend capex and do bare minimum essentials to ride through this situation^” said Sood of PVR.

And to aid those working remotely^ the company has put together a handy “Guide to working from home.” It is a document that Microsoft has created “to provide their employees with guidance^ tips^ and resources during the COVID-19 outbreak. The company has made this available publicly for other companies to use as a starting point for guiding their employees to work remotely.Here are some interesting tips from the presentation: Set Up Your Physical Workspace Start by identifying a ‘work base’ where your equipment and materials remain undisturbed^ even if you shift locations during the day. This is essentially your workstation. Maybe you could even consider personalising it^ the way your actual workstation in office is. Get Your Video Ready Technology is helping as many are moving conversations to virtual meeting rooms^ with video calls. You may want to brush up on your video etiquette. For example^ check your surroundings. Be aware of what is in view^ and try to minimize distractions and protect privacy. Pets and kids may pop in anyway but one lives in hope. Be Present And Respectful Limit multitasking during meetings. Turning on your video can show that you are paying attention and allow you to focus on the person or people on your call. If the option is available^ blur your background to reduce distractions. Pause For Others To Speak In a virtual setting it is hard to tell when it’s polite to interject and when it’s not. If you are the team lead^ make sure there’s time and opportunity for all voices to be heard. Perhaps intervene if any one person seems to be dominating the conversation for too long.The COVID-19 quarantine has been an emotional experience for most people. It has been reflective and challenging in equal measure. Generally^ isolation allows a rethink about life^ about your immediate surroundings and your relationships.Covid-19 has had similar effects on personal transformation. From my conversations with colleagues & friends^ the words that consistently appeared are mindfulness^ meaningful relationships^ gratitude and respect for nature.And^ why not?Connecting virtually has been almost like a life-support system during the quarantine period. It has also established the concept of virtual life as an everyday existence. What will people seek & how can innovators help? We already see online communities that bond strongly over shared interests^ making the virtual world stronger than ever before. We know that language has a cultural context and there is room for miscommunication^ especially in chats and emails. There is an opportunity to go beyond spelling and grammar autocorrect; having a ‘culture autocorrect’ phrase setting to smoothen interaction and ease communication. In an official context^ virtual connections are not as easy as they seem^ especially when we work with colleagues from different cultures around the world.Our professional interactions are different from our personal ones^ we express ourselves differently at work. Today we use emojis less often in the professional context^ as they are quite personal. With increasing virtual office interactions^ it would be a great communication tool to have Professional Expression emojis.While on the subject of communication^ creating a ‘virtual jamming space’ for colleagues to hang out^ akin to a smoke break or a coffee break^ could facilitate chats^ which are not possible in formal emails or team meetings.There is constant innovation in the digital world^ newer versions and technologies replacing the old. As a user^ the one thing I wish virtual interactions allowed^ is a sensorial experience. We are witnessing virtual birthday celebrations^ parties^ and culinary achievements online during the quarantine phase. I am imagining an ‘experience genie’ device attachment or app that has pre-loaded sensorial information. Imagine at a virtual birthday party^ if one could blow a candle across a video call^ or smell the dish your mother has cooked while seeing the picture or being able to smell your loved ones‘ perfume when you speak to them would make the experience intensely personal.And like virtual life^ real life will see changes too. For public places like theatres^ museums^ there is a possibility that people prefer to book space rather than seats to ensure that they are not in close quarters with strangers.The home office is already seeing innovations in terms of suitable lighting for video calls^ pre-built home office space in apartments^ ergonomic seating and many such ideas to make working from home effective. I am sure there will soon be home office fashion that will allow people to transition from giving the pro vibe on an office call to effortlessly being a homebody.It will be interesting to see whether the Covid-19 quarantine becomes like an adventure boot camp with memories and stories or if it brings about a lasting change. Coupled with globalization and mobility^ I believe it will bring about a change and this is just the beginning. In the post-Covid world^ we will face new issues and need new solutions.

We are also working on neem and tulsi treated fabrics for Peter England for greater degree of wellness^” said Vishak Kumar^ CEO of Madura Fashion & Lifestyle.Factories of Peter England^ Louis Philippe^ Allen Solly and Van Heusen are tailoring masks with comfort^ fit and shape analytics for adults and kids^ he said.The move comes at a time when the core apparel market has been forced to shut down owing to the lockdown. Fashion brands suffered a 70% fall in sales in March due to closure of malls. Masks as a quintessential accessory will help brands use existing stock material and drive cash flow.“Fashion is the right industry to manufacture masks. The category is a definite commercial opportunity. It is not just a phase but a year-long trend^” said J Suresh^ chief executive at Arvind Fashions which will launch masks under US Polo Assn^ Unlimited and Flying Machine brands.Lifestyle brands Puma India and Hidesign too are set to launch masks in the next few months. Even suits and trousers have come under the health canopy as textile makers Donear Group of Companies and Grado have developed an anti-viral fabric to stay relevant.According to Sandeep Kataria^ CEO of Bata India^ the footwear company plans to introduce masks under its sports brand Power and broaden antibacterial school shoes range to adults.Liberty Shoes is launching a new brand called Reset to sell washable virus-and-fungi resistant slip-in shoes^ flip flops and casual footwear^ said director-retail Anupam Bansal.With a more pervasive preventive mindset^ demand for masks at chemists expanded 50-80% and the average order on ecommerce platforms increased more than four times in the 30-day period ending mid-March^ according to a Nielsen report.Fashion etailer Myntra^ which restarted operations with delivery of masks^ has created a dedicated ‘essentials’ section on its menu driven by the growing demand of the category in the past couple of weeks. “We are looking to sell PPE (personal protective equipment) such as overalls^ visors and helmets in the coming months. Discussions are also on with brands experimenting with anti-virus clothing^” said Ayyappan Rajagopal^ head of business at Myntra.

Public transport still isn’t running in many parts of India.“Most companies have been shying (away from) automation^ which is a one-time large expense^ compared to having labour at factories that needs smaller but long-term investment ^” said B Krishna Rao^ category head at Parle Products^ the country’s biggest food company.“But we have to invest now so that we avoid such a situation in future^ similar to what most factories in the developed world adopted decades ago.”Companies also fear that a portion of the workforce may not return to the cities even after the lockdown is lifted as they will look to newly created employment opportunities in their home states.Many had been forced to trek thousands of kilometres back home after they found themselves without any income and buses and trains stopped running when the lockdown was first imposed in March. Factories have restarted this month as the government tries to revive the stalled economy.“There can be huge opportunity cost due to labour shortage once demand stabilises^” said Angshu Mallick^ deputy chief executive of Adani Wilmar^ which sells edible oil^ atta and rice. “We will now closely evaluate each and every part of operations to see how the labour requirement (can be) drastically minimised^ especially casual workforce for operations such as packaging^ loading and supply chain.”Dabur is evaluating end-of-the-line automation at its manufacturing units but needs workers now^ said executive director Shahrukh Khan.“In cases where we are unable to get local workers^ we are seeking permission from local authorities for inter-state movement of labour to fill the need gap arising from migrant workers returning to their hometowns^” he said.Unlike other consumer-facing sectors such as auto and electronics^ FMCG has largely steered clear of automation. “This is due to skepticism around its effectiveness in the highly traditional^ trade-dominated-business market and the abundant availability of manpower^” said Varun Chaudhary^ executive director^ CG Corp Global.However^ several firms have been investing in technology with the pace picking up in the past few years. This will now be fast-tracked. “Automation along with outsourcing to third-party manufacturers can help meet production targets^” said Sunil Kataria^ chief executive officer at Godrej Consumer Products.Marico said it will explore more automation initiatives across the distribution and supply chain network once the situation stabilises. “Right now^ we are operating with a much lower strength of staff at factories and third-party providers because of the strict safety norms we have deployed^” said Marico managing director Saugata Gupta.

So^ we are talking about companies distributing. There are some companies which get to say 14 million outlets^ but we also get to 5.5 million outlets. Now while e-commerce has been growing exponentially^ during this period we have seen a 300% growth. But with that 300% growth^ we are just about getting to a percentage of our sales. So yes^ it will grow^ maybe in times to come^ it will go from 1% to 2% to 3% to 5%.But the reality is that there still will be this huge base of the pyramid that you will have to make sure that you keep serving. I do not think distribution strategies are going to change in a hurry. I do think that it will remain to be a situation where you will have to service kirana because they are so entrepreneurial in their way they operate that they service their own markets wherever they are in a way e-commerce would do in a large city.These entrepreneurial guys are going to remain as long as they have the infrastructure^ they have servicing from companies like us. They will continue to exist. I do not think we are looking at a huge change in our philosophy as far as distribution is concerned.We have such strong brands with so much pull that it is easiest for us to say that we will take the route of a pull strategy versus push strategy. But I will tell you that can be disastrous. Some 8-10 years back^ in a somehow modified way^ we had gone towards that and that impacted us very badly. We are not looking at doing that in a hurry. We will continue to have direct distribution to 2.5 odd million retailers. We will continue to make sure that we service our wholesalers. That strategy will continue. Yes we will have disproportionate focus on modern trade or e-commerce and on alternate channels^ etc^ and we will make sure that we nurture them as we go forward^ but base strategy will not change.Yes^ I would think so. We have cut out because it was an issue of availability more than anything else. We did cut out a lot of costs from our sales and marketing system and I think a lot of other companies would have done the same. What happens is frankly all of the push money that we spend some of it is necessary but 50% of that is for a competitive reason. The day everyone realises that it is not about pushing on versus the other^ it is about making sure that your execution is good^ your brands are strong and you do what is necessary from the perspective of the market.There will be a lot of savings coming to any industry. There will be learnings from this. I do think and I do hope that companies will take a leaf out of this crisis and start to taper down all the extraneous spends. We have certainly done it and we are looking forward to continuing that as we go forward as well.I would agree with you but I would not agree with the fact that we will cut our ad spends. We have cut our ad spends till now but as brands get into the normal days of stock that we hold in our system^ we will start to get back as far as advertising is concerned. In fact^ this month we will get back to advertising for some of our brands where we have got enough product. That will be temporary. I would not say that that is a long term phenomenon. Obviously^ we will nurture and build our brands for the future.We might change our strategy. Actually at this point in time^ it seems everyone is sitting at home and watching television. It is probably the right time to advertise if you have got products as everyone is going to watch you and imbibe you. So we will start doing that.We will but you have to understand that we have a labour issue even till now. Migrant workers have gone back and there are certain plants. So^ we are operating with a lower number of workers in every factory and with that^ prioritisation becomes important and hence we are staying away from innovations. But as I said^ as we get to sufficiency^ we will start to unleash some of our innovation products. Some of our categories where we have been silent for a long period and hopefully that will start to happen in the next 15 days to a month. But we will be careful^ we will not load the pipe with too many initiatives at this point in time. It may be one at a time so that it can be focussed by our field force as well as by all our people in the backend as well.Well at this point in time yes and you have seen it in our last quarter results. Even our operating margins went up but you have got to look at how it is going to be sustainable after a period of time. Yes we will unearth all opportunities and we will try and see how we make our business efficient going forward^ but in the long term it has to be seen and we have to craft out what is necessary to get.No^ if you think about it we are in the band. We improved our operating margins from 4% seven-eight years ago to 15% and thereabouts so we would certainly want to progress.Progress could be high at these kinds of times. But it will remain in that ballpark.The margins go beyond the top and then you know it becomes easy to meet for a lot of other people to come in. Yes^ there will be progress on what we have been doing and we have been doing continuous progress. We will continue that but it does not mean a 15% margin is going to be 20% in a hurry. We will progress slowly and steadily and try and move our margins.

The overall industry sentiments do not showcase an encouraging outlook of the market.""To be relevant in the job market the job seekers need to keep themselves updating and always look for upskilling themselves as per the industry trends. Hiring is happening in the health industry^ essential retail^ some IT or web enabled services and e-commerce sectors^” Genius Consultants Chairman and Managing Director R P Yadav said.As it will take around 6-7 months to the recovery process of the current financial crisis^ hence the job market will also see its upliftment accordingly^ he added.The online survey was done over a period of three months with over 1^200 respondents who are at management level across various sectors including auto and auto ancillary^ banking and finance^ construction and engineering^ education^ FMCG^ and hospitality among others."

An average of seven sectors that a study by Avtar Group covered shows women ’s representation has risen from 18.7% in 2016 to 25.7% in 2019^ and it is expected to cross 26% this year. Avtar is a leading diversity and inclusion (D&I) firm.The report is based on data from across 353 companies that employ more than 10 lakh women.Sector-wise^ it’s a mixed bag though. Consulting ^ fast-moving consumer goods and information technology and information technology-enabled services (IT and ITeS ) are expected to inch up on the percentage of women’s representation in 2020 while pharmaceuticals and hospitality could see a dip.Saundarya Rajesh^ founder president of Avtar^ said^ “Consulting industry has a greater diversity consciousness. With more women pursuing MBAs ^ the FMCG sector has enhanced its gender diversity quotient. On the other hand^ manufacturing^ which is the lowest in terms of women’s representation (8% in 2019)^ is expected to bounce back this year to over 10%. The initial blip in women’s representation in manufacturing could be an effect of market conditions. However^ it could become a potent career option for women as the industry is becoming increasingly tech-enabled.”Women’s representation in consulting^ which has their highest representation in India^ is estimated to reach 44% by 2020.FMCG has seen an increase in women from 12% in 2016 to 20% in 2020. Companies are not only actively hiring from a gender distributed talent pool^ they are also introducing innovative variants of flexibility^ like location free roles^ which is an important enabler for women.

Commensurate with this^ it seems natural that corporates will knock the door of secondary markets to raise money. There has already been a huge amount of capital raising through QIPs and this is just the start.PSU banks^ too^ have entered the league and are planning to raise capital from the secondary market^ which is a rare phenomenon. Empirical evidence suggests so much optimism combined with a capital raising spree can be danger zone for the bulls. In addition to this^ stocks that are under F&O ban^ too^ have started rising^ which calls for caution going ahead.Hence^ investors should remain cautious and should ideally not participate^ as these euphoric times are triggered merely by liquidity. Mutual fund inflows has also become little topsy-turvy. Historically^ during market panics^ mutual funds used to see outflows in the equity weakness and inflows during buoyancy. Courtesy Covid-19^ this trend seems to have got distorted abruptly! Retail investors are seen taking money off the table from equity mutual funds and are routing that to debt instruments. In a surprise contrast^ FPIs have done record purchases in August 2020^ setting a tug-of-war between Indian retail investors. It appears retail investors have become smarter by taking money out from equity mutual funds at peak stock prices. But only time will tell who will win this round.India Inc’s Q2FY21 earnings will be a litmus test for visibility of corporate earnings and^ if the momentum sustains^ the market will sail into new highs. Otherwise we may experience a sharp correction going forward^ and the odds for a correction are higher.The most sought-after precious metals^ gold and silver^ witnessed a massive sell-off during the week gone by on the back of a precipitous increase in helicopter money. Central banks and governments^ too^ are aggressively favouring fresh stimulus to boost the economy^ which happens to be an ideal setup for gold bulls. In spite such optimism^ precious metals corrected 5-15 per cent. Such eventualities in equities^ too^ cannot be ruled out. Amid such optimism^ markets may have registered tops and^ therefore^ both trading and investing now call for appropriate risk management and disciplined approach.After opening with a minor gap on the upside^ Nifty50 traded in a narrow range throughout the week and closed in the red^ led by the banks. The market’s short-term trend has turned downward and a retest of the 10^900 level cannot be ruled out. Hence^ investors are advised to remain cautious. On the upside^ resistance is placed at 11^380 level. However^ a downside break of the 10^900 level will mark an uptrend reversal and a sharp correction may begin thereafter.Frontline stocks are expected to maintain a low profile^ but smallcap and midcap stocks might continue their final journey of up-move. Sectoral rotation can be expected from stocks where a smart run-up was seen during the week and money may go into underperforming sectors and stocks.It is expected that realty^ NBFCs^ infrastructure sectors may witness buying and there could be profit booking in sectors like pharma^ IT^ cement and FMCG . One needs to maintain a stock-specific approach. Traders and investors are advised to continue their cautious stock-picking approach.Nifty50 closed the week at 11^178^ down 0.3 per cent

However^ the impact will be much larger^ to the tune of 30-40 per cent^ if the lockdowns continue beyond the first quarter^ Crisil said in its report on Wednesday.It added that the crippling impact of the pandemic will trigger a rush by private equity players who will be keen to take over the most distressed companies^ given the changing consumer priorities to health and wellness.""The disruption in demand^ production and supply chain caused by the extended nationwide lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic will knock back revenue growth by 2-4 per cent for the consumer essentials sector^ and 16-30 per cent across discretionary manufacturing and consumer services this fiscal^"" the report said.However^ it warned that ""this is only in the base-case scenario of the lockdown ending in the first quarter. In case of extended vulnerability due to fresh extension of the lockdown into the second quarter^ the fall could be a steeper 30-40 per cent.""It further said discretionary segments like appliances^ ready mades and quick service restaurants will be hit the hardest and see steepest revenue plunge under both scenarios and their stretched working capital cycles will put further squeeze on liquidity^ impacting profitability.What is more^ these segments will also take the longest to recover post-lockdown^ while discretionary spending will take at least a year to recoup.The only segments that will recover fast are e-retail and essential items^ the report said^ adding ""these will also bounce back within a month as consumers turn brand-agnostic and switch to available local brands^ and as e-retail platforms meet the need for contactless shopping and doorstep delivery.""According to Rahul Prithiani^ director at Crisil^ ""consumer behaviour will change in the near-term as availability^ convenience^ affordability^ hygiene and safety become priorities. The shift in brand loyalty due to unavailability will boost sales of local/SME brands which have flexible logistics.""""Sensing this^ retailers and fast-moving consumer goods companies have started tying up with food delivery service providers to suit consumers' quest for convenience.

07 May^ 2019,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/indias-consumption-story-losing-the-plot/articleshow/69210037.cms,Economic Times,Hindustan Unilever: India’s consumption story losing the plot,OthersConsumption is sputtering across a range of products including cars^ two-wheelers^ air travel and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)^ with volumes dropping to multi-quarter lows. The decline in demand stems from an income growth slump in urban and rural areas that’s forced people to curb spending^ falling money supply in the economy and rising uncertainty over how customers will respond to regulatory action^ experts said. The next government may need to prime the pump as consumption has been one of the engines that has been driving the economy in the absence of private investment and exports.“You can’t say FMCG is recession proof but it is recession resistant^” said Hindustan Unilever chairman Sanjiv Mehta during a press briefing after March quarter results. “People don’t stop bathing or cleaning their teeth when conditions become tough. What happens is the number of brands in a family gets reduced —instead of using larger packs^ they shift to more price-point packs. That’s the kind of shift that happens.”Passenger car volumes have dropped in nine of the past 10 months. Growth was down to 2% in the last fiscal year^ the lowest in five. Two-wheeler volume growth fell to the lowest since the currency note swap exercise in November 2016.Volume growth at leading FMCG companies that derive more than a third of sales from rural areas has dropped to a six-seven-quarter low. Indian airlines carried 11.6 million passengers in March^ a mere 0.1 percentage point higher than a year earlier^ representing the slowest increase since June 2013.Experts cited three key factors. Farm income growth has been weak for over two years with prices having stayed low^ as reflected in the marginal rise in agricultural inflation. The growth in nominal gross domestic product (GDP) for agriculture was 2% in the October-December 2018 period^ the slowest in any quarter since April-June 2012.Second^ the benefit of price reduction due to the reduction in goods and services tax (GST) has run its course. The third reason is the liquidity crunch sparked by the Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) default in September last year. In any case^ according to Credit Suisse ^ money supply as measured by M3^ has lagged behind GDP growth since 2016.“Macro (household savings data) and micro (sector and company volume data) suggest that households may have gradually reduced consumption due to insufficient income growth^” Sanjeev Prasad of Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.Axis Capital economist Prithviraj Srinivas said income growth patterns and nominal agricultural GDP growth indicated that consumption trend has been slowing since from 2017. Disruptions due to demonetisation and GST implementation have accentuated this^ he said.Maruti Suzuki’s volumes dropped 17.2% in April^ the sharpest decline since August 2012. In April^ top-selling models such as the Baleno^ Dzire and Swift witnessed a volume drop of 15-31% year-on-year. The company has guided for 4-8% volume growth for the current fiscal.The lower end of that range implies the slowest growth in five years. The current fiscal is unpredictable since customer response to price changes due to new regulatory norms pertaining to emissions is unknown^ said Maruti CFO Ajay Seth in a post-earnings conference call.Carmakers have two options owing to regulatory disruption^ said Gaurav Vangal^ country head^ production forecast^ at IHS Automotive. They could show 5-6% volume growth in the current year and negative growth for the next year^ or calibrate the current year volume growth to 1-2% and restrict themselves from posting negative growth for the next year^ he said.A senior official at a leading car maker said that volume growth is unlikely to recover before the early second half of the current fiscal as inventory adjustment between wholesale and retail will take some months. Hero MotoCorp said in a post-March quarter conference call that inventory levels are 10 days higher than average.The worst-affected segment in two-wheelers has been the scooter segment^ where growth turned negative in FY19 for the first time in 13 years. Scooters are typically used in urban areas.The average volume growth of HUL Dabur and GCPL was 6% in the March quarter^ 2.66 percentage points over the previous quarter^ and management commentary indicates a further moderation in the April-June period.HUL’s volume growth fell 7%^ the lowest in six quarters^ with the narrowest margin expansion in 10 quarters. According to HUL^ rural growth was 1.1 times urban demand in the March quarter compared with 1.3 times in the previous quarter.

The trend may not reverse any time soon^ given the muted volume guidance by the country’s largest lubricant maker for the current fiscal^ coupled with sluggish demand scenario. The company’s fiscal ends in December.The volume growth of Castrol India^ a subsidiary of British Petroleum^ dropped by 2.1 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to 50.4 million litres in the March quarter against the expectation of a 4-6 per cent growth.The drop was due to the lower demand from the personal mobility segment which includes passenger cars^ two-wheelers^ and commercial vehicles. The company generates nearly a two-thirds of its sales volume from personal mobility^ while the rest comes from the industrial lubricant segment^ which also reported weak demand during the quarter.The demand may take a while to revive^ given the continued slowdown in the passenger vehicles segment^ which recorded an eightyear low monthly growth in April. This is likely to put pressure on Castrol’s volume growth.Analyst expect Castrol’s volume to grow by 1.9 per cent for 2019^ the lowest in the past five years. To reach the projected volume growth^ the company must maintain a quarterly volume run rate of 55.5 million litres in the remaining three quarters compared with 50.3 in the March quarter.In a post-March earnings conference call^ the company’s management said that the volume growth may remain at the lower end of the medium-term guidance of 2-4 per cent and that is after considering a possible recovery in the second half. According to Bloomberg consensus estimate^ the company’s projected revenue growth is at 7.7 per cent and 6.3 per cent for 2019 and 2020^ respectively. It means the majority of the momentum will be from better realisation amid lower volume.In the March quarter^ the company’s revenue grew by 5 per cent^ mainly driven by a 7 per cent growth in average realisation at Rs 193.7 per litre. However^ sustaining a higher realisation will be a tall task. Even the company’s guidance indicates that contribution margin per litre — average realisation minus raw material per litre — is unlikely to rise above Rs 100 per litre. This may put a cap on the company’s ability to drive realisation. The contribution margin was Rs 103.1 per litre in the March quarter.The stock is available at19.5 times its projected 12-month earnings^ a discount of 31 per cent compared with its five-year average. Historically^ the company has enjoyed valuation similar to that of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) owing to its pricing power and dominant market share.However^ the premium is gradually chipping off due to a low single-volume growth^ while FMCG companies have been posting a double-digit volume growth since the last five quarters. A sluggish demand outlook may further dent the company’s valuation.

It was expected but I am not so enthused about it because it creates lingering problems for the banking sector and when the economy actually starts recovering^ then credit flow becomes an issue^” said Sandip Sabharwal^ an independent market analyst.He believes outperformance will come from other sectors^ possibly FMCG companies which are indicating a robust outlook or maybe some select pharma companies. He added that IT stocks are more or less priced in.Investors^ however^ seem to think otherwise. Nifty IT was the biggest sectoral gainer^ up 1.78 per cent^ followed by Nifty FMCG that added 1.37 per cent.Tata Steel was the biggest bluechip gainer^ jumping 3.82 per cent to Rs 400.55^ riding on higher sales of steelmakers during July. Buying on Tata Steel and other metal stocks took Nifty Metal up 1.37 per cent.Broader market also saw good demand by investors as 1^579 stocks closed with gains while 1^079 names ended in the red. Over 160 stocks hit their 52-week high levels^ most of them from small and micro-cap categories.BSE Midcap was up 0.77 per cent^ driven by up to 9 per cent gain in Tata Consumer^ M&M Financial^ Varroc Engineering and Torrent Pharma BSE Smallcap climbed 0.99 per cent thanks to 10-19 per cent jump in Aarti Drugs^ Birlasoft^ Vimta Labs^ Astral Poly^ SH Kelkar and Hamna Auto.Manappuram Finance and Muthoot Finance^ two industry leaders in loan against gold^ saw dramatic movements during the day. Both stocks spiked after the RBI increased loan-to-value ratio but plunged after clarification that this was not valid for NBFCs. Eventually^ Manappuram Finance dropped 2.79 per cent and Muthoot Finance tanked 5.38 per cent to Rs 1^189.75.Investors were not too enthused about the overwhelming response to HDFC QIP that was subscribed four times despite floor price set at a premium. The stock closed up just 0.49 per cent to Rs 1^785.65.Major Asian markets ended the day in red. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan hit an early-session six-and-a-half-month peak but fell back to be flat after drops in China and Hong Kong.“European stocks edged lower as the Bank of England warned of a slower economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis and investors digested a raft of earnings. This is despite German industrial orders surged 27.9 per cent month-on-month in June^ smashing economists’ expectations for a 10.1 per cent rise^ led by strong demand for domestic goods^” said Deepak Jasani^ Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities."

GCPL has planned several launches at affordable price points^ most of which would be in personal and home care category^ in the next 45 days. It expects hygiene products to account for around 5 per cent of its total business in this quarter alone as compared to very insignificant contribution in pre-COVID-19 period.It is also looking to introduce a range of hygiene products for personal consumption^ home care and hygiene on-the-go category.""For us it is not just about the next quarter^ you will see a lot more launches over the next 45 days as we are looking at building the hygiene category as our new core over the next 2 or 3 years^"" GCPL Managing Director and CEO Vivek Gambhir told .Elaborating further he said^ ""we have actually moved very quickly and launched hygiene products across India^ Indonesia^ Bangladesh^ Sri Lanka^ Kenya^ South Africa^ the US^ Argentina and Chile. There are a lot more launches planned over the next 45 days.""During the pandemic^ several companies have forayed into the hand sanitiser segment^ which was hitherto considered to a niche product.According to Gambhir^ the hand sanitiser space is ""quite crowded"" and the real opportunity is more in handwash and other personal and home care products.Gambhir said that the new products in the hygiene would be affordable and may ""disrupt the market"" as well.Besides^ the Godrej Group firm also believes that it is a ""resurgence time"" for its home insecticide segment^ which contributes around 30 per cent of its global and 40 per cent of domestic business^ as awareness on diseases prevention in general has increased in the COVID-19 times.Gambhir also said GCPL expects its soaps category^ which contributes around 20 per cent of its revenue^ to grow further.The company has a ranges of brands across personal and home care such as Cinthol^ Protekt^ Ezee^ Godrej No 1 and Hit and Good Knight.On distribution^ like other FMCG companies^ GCPL is also expanding its digital initiatives and increasing its presence in the e-commerce channels. The company is working with the channels partners and is also engaging through business-to-consumer (B2C) model^ selling the products directly to the end-users.On Wednesday^ GCPL reported a decline of 75 per cent to Rs 230 cr in its Q4 net profit^ while its net sales fell 12 per cent to Rs 2^132.7 crore for January-March quarter.For the financial year^ GCPL's net profit was Rs 1^496.58 crore^ down 36.08 per cent over the year-ago period and net sales stood at Rs 9^826.51 crore^ down 3.86 per cent.GCPL's performance in India and African markets was impacted during the lockdown ^ however^ in some markets as Indonesia^ it has reported growth this quarter despite challenges.""Inspite of these unprecedented challenges^ we actually gained shares in most categories. We have gained around 70 per cent of our portfolio^ which is quite encouraging^"" he said adding ""this reflects that we are positioned quite well for the future."""

Then I opened another paper^ news there was in deeper red. After that I looked at the stock market screen and it was in bright green.’This joke well sums up the economy and financial markets for April. Covid-19 has held most economic activity at ransom while stock markets are on a roll. Many participants are probably looking at a sharp recovery (called V-shaped in the financial jargon).Speculators and investors are banking on a government stimulus and ultra-low interest rates which could pull the Indian economy from this unprecedented crisis. In addition^ the Reserve Bank of India is providing a backstop - that is^ even junk bonds have no worry of default. The RBI will rescue them. Traditional theory of risk and return has been turned on its head by such policies.For the 4 months of calendar 2020^ S&P BSE Sensex return is negative 18%. Despite the fact that the S&P BSE Sensex surged 14.4% during the month of April (14.6% in USD). This follows a 22.8% decline in the previous month when India went into a stringent lockdown from March 24th. The performance of the S&P BSE Sensex was slightly better than the developed market indices such as S&P 500 (12.8%) and Dow Jones (11.2%) (Both in USD terms).Midcap and small cap indices had gains similar to that of the Sensex during April. S&P BSE Midcap index rose 13.7% while S&P BSE Smallcap leapt 15.5% in the month.Healthcare^ auto and oil & gas were some of the sectors which did extremely well in the month of April. Positive news flow in terms of new drug approvals and plant approval from FDA helped pharma stocks.Non-cyclical sectors such as FMCG and consumer durables were among the least gainers in April. Real estate and PSUs rounded up the laggard sectors. The Indian rupee appreciated 0.7% during the month v/s US dollar.YTD - Year To Date | MTD - Month To DateFPIs had a quiet month during April. They were net sellers of $31 million. So far^ in the current year^ the FPIs have sold stocks worth $6.6 billion. Domestic institutions (DIIs) were also net sellers to the tune of $100 million in April. However^ since January 2020^ the DFIs have cumulatively purchased $10 billion worth of stocks.The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the world economy has been higher than any previous event including the two World Wars. Developed countries are looking at a contraction of between 8-16% in their GDP. For some countries^ like the UK^ this would be the biggest decline in economic output in the last 200 years. For many countries^ it could take about 2 years to reach the same level of GDP that was recorded in 2019.Since there doesn’t seem to be a cure or vaccine to contain the pandemic^ the economic problems are likely to drag on and become more acute if the governments still insist on lockdowns. Many small businesses are on the verge of closure and unemployment rates will be at a historic high. World over^ there is going to be higher corporate bankruptcy than any time in recent history.The lockdown has been particularly strict in India. All economic activity - except for farm and few essential goods – have been suspended. Given the severe impact on livelihoods and incomes^ the wait for fiscal stimulus has gotten longer. So far the size of the stimulus has been only 0.8% of GDP. Even by conservative estimates^ the country needs a stimulus of at least Rs 10 trillion (5% of GDP).The lockdown was supposed to end on 14 April but was extended till 3 May. After that^ the country was divided into 3 zones and some relaxation was given in green and orange zones. Estimates suggest that approximately 48% of economic activity lies in the red zones where stringent measures continue. Manufacturing output^ as measured by PMI or the Purchasing Managers’ Index^ stood at 27.4 in April. It is normally above 50 - the current level is a 15-year low. Unemployment levels^ as measured by CMIE^ have touched levels closer to 25% from 7% before lockdown.An absence of a stimulus can lead to a significant social and economic problem. This would make economic recovery even more difficult in the successive years. The rising NPAs of the financial system^ closure of critical industries^ and the massive rise in unemployment are some of the collateral damage in the absence of a significant government economic revival packageMany listed companies are declaring their results for the last quarter and for the full year of fiscal 2020. Given the prevailing situation^ the demand revival and normalisation of operations could take 6-12 months from levels pre Covid-19. We understand it could be even longer given uncertainty of economy opening. All companies are looking at drastic cost cutting measures to compensate for lost sales.The current economic scenario is challenging for many companies. Many companies may not survive and some will emerge weaker after the current crisis. Few other companies^ however^ will emerge stronger and benefit from consolidation in respective industries. We have chosen stocks which we believe be winners in the long term.India is likely to grow faster than many nations. The economy is dependent on domestic consumption and insulated from any global problems over the long term. While economic growth faces pressure in the near term^ a better monsoon and measures to ease liquidity are likely to stimulate growth. While economic activity has halted in urban areas^ things are much better in rural areas. Rural India is likely to bounce back sooner after the lockdown is lifted.India could also be a gainer from the Covid crisis if it positions itself well. Many companies are looking to restructure supply chain away from China. Manufacturing sector can capitalize on this opportunity with the support of government policies.April witnessed 6 debt schemes of a mutual fund house unable to pay money to its investors and deciding to wind up. These schemes had approximately Rs 250 billion in AUM. Severe market dislocation^ the illiquidity due to Covid-19^ and high credit risks were the reasons for the closure as per media reports. Such events can test the financial system which is already fragile.Quantum Long Term Equity Value Fund saw a 15.4% appreciation in its NAV. In comparison its benchmark BSE 200 had 14.7% return in April. The scheme’s holdings in healthcare and auto stocks contributed positively to its performance. Some IT stocks and a PSU bank dragged overall performance for the month.For the 4 months of 2020^ the scheme’s performance is -20.6% as compared to -18.1% for the benchmark. Cash level in the Scheme was 8% at month end. Many stocks were re-jigged during the month. Given the challenges to discretionary spending in the current scenario^ we cut our position in 2-wheeler stocks. On the heightened risk to banking^ a PSU stock was also trimmed. The scheme also reduced position in an IT stock where upside appeared limited.We remain positive on equities in the long run even as a sharp rally in April has reduced the very attractive upside potential. Investors should use this opportunity to deploy capital in equity mutual funds if they don’t have enough exposure to the asset class. Investors should continue with SIPs to take advantage of better valuations and volatility.(Atul Kumar is the head of equities at Quantum Mutual Fund)

This comes amid job and pay cuts across companies due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown.The companies cited above said they will review decisions about the current year’s variable payouts and salary hikes over the coming months as India Inc reels under the economic cost of the outbreak.“The variable pay for the previous year as well as increments have been paid out^” said a spokesperson for the country’s biggest listed consumer goods maker HUL^ which follows the April-March cycle.The maker of Lux soap and Lipton tea^ which employs about 21^000 people and reported a 7% decline in volumes for the March quarter^ said it is revisiting any further increases planned for the rest of the year. Parent Unilever had said in March it would protect its workforce from sudden drops in pay as a result of market disruption or being unable to perform their roles for up to three months.The India unit of Swiss packaged foods maker Nestle^ which reported its best quarterly sales growth in nearly five years globally as consumers stocked up amid lockdowns^ said full salaries to all employees have been paid and relevant increments and bonuses given as planned with no reductions whatsoever.“Our employees are at the centre of who we are and we’re not considering any cut in salaries nor envisaged any curtailment of employment^” said a spokesperson for Nestle India.The company makes infant cereal Nan^ Maggi noodles and KitKat chocolate. He said all offers for new employees^ inclusive of summer internships across campuses and management trainee positions^ have been honoured.Beverage maker Coca-Cola’s company-owned bottling partner Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (HCCB) announced a 7-8% increment for its 7^000 direct employees^ which it said is a function of “several factors including employee performance in the preceding year.” The company said the impact of the pandemic would be “severe” in this year as lockdown measures have led to a big slump in consumption^ especially in out-of-home segment. The company wanted to support employees at a time of uncertainty^ given the overall economic climate. “One of the first things we did amid uncertainty over the pandemic was to reassure employees that there will be no layoffs^ salary reductions and job losses^” the spokesperson said.Companies need to instill confidence in their staff by honouring their pledges^ recruiters said. “Bonuses and incentives should be paid to employees^ even if they are staggered and paid in parts — like a percentage now and the rest over a period of few months^” said Shiv Agrawal^ managing director of ABC Consulting^ an executive search firm.Some others like Reckitt Benckiser said they will take decisions on payouts^ but there would be no layoffs.A spokesperson for the India unit of Dettol and Lizol disinfectant maker said layoffs were not planned neither foreseen.“Whether we give increments or not will be based on multiple factors and can’t be determined now^ since we follow a January-December cycle^” a spokesperson said. “It will be based on industry benchmarks and global guidance.”White goods maker Whirlpool Corp vice president HR Sarthak Raychaudhuri also said the company has given hikes and bonus payouts for the previous year^ with no reduction in salaries or adjustments to sales incentives. “We may undertake a temporary salary reduction for some senior management depending on business cycles returning to normal. Annual bonus for 2020 would be impacted^” he said.Cigarettes and consumer goods maker ITC’s spokesperson said the company doesn’t intend to make “any changes to employee compensation” as of now.Others like consulting firm Bain & Co and information technology company Capgemini said they are going ahead with increments and promotions between April and June. “We have ensured that last year’s strong results are reflected in variable payouts^ without any impact of the ongoing situation^” a Capgemini spokesperson said.
13 May^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/only-15-commercial-vehicles-are-plying/articleshow/75704419.cms,Economic Times,Only 15% commercial vehicles are plying,MUMBAI: Images of thousands of trucks^ some full of goods^ stuck on state and national highways have flashed through daily news bulletins on television that have become commonplace nationwide offering a window to another industry unmoored by the Covid-19 lockdown Only 15% of the 25 lakh commercial vehicles are plying across India. The worst affected are automobile carriers; out of 18^000 car carriers ^ 1^500 have been repossessed as have been a tenth of 20^000 two-wheeler carriers Not only is there no freight demand^ idle fleet and high operating costs have made the business unviable.“Vehicles are stranded on highways for lack of drivers due to no demand for cement^ steel^ car carriers^” said Mukesh Chetak^ a Delhi-based operator having a fleet size of 2^400 large trucks. Except those ferrying pharmaceutical^ FMCG and essential goods^ all other goods carriers have been affected. Several large fleet operators are unable to pay vehicle EMIs and face the threat of banks and financial institutions repossessing their vehicles.Already^ the commercial vehicle loan delinquency is currently the highest in the retail loan portfolio.“The core is how fast can economic activity resume^ which will lead to movement of goods^” said TT Srinivasaraghavan^ MD^ Sundaram Finance — largest CV financing NBFC Typically^ a truck loan ranges from Rs 3 lakh at the lower end to Rs 30 lakh for the premium segment. These are five-year loans and financiers fund 95-100% of the cost.Players like Tata Motors Finance have started exploring options such as bill discounting^ rescheduling of term loans^ private equity funding^ working capital solutions and lease options to such fleet operators.Industry players feel that while financiers are left with no other option but to take back the vehicle^ it will lead a large section of the drivers to changing their current occupation. “It is difficult to get drivers^ even if we are willing to pay more^” said Sushil Rathi^ COO^ Mahindra Logistics.“At this point in time repossession of truck may lead to inventory pile-up at stock yards and add to paralysis at government entities like RTOs^ which may lead to delay in transaction closure inspite of our preparedness to fund such trucks^” said Anil Menon^ head of CV financing at Yes Bank.“The toll collection figures are showing an upward trend. Currently^ the major issues faced by transporters are non-availability of drivers^ elongation of payment cycle and uncertainty of return load^” said Amit Mohan^ joint president^ Kotak Mahindra Bank.With the RBI likely to extend the loan moratorium for another three months till September^ it gives consumers a breather^ financiers said. Approximately 90% of the CV customers who have taken loan from NBFCs and 70% of borrowers of private banks have opted for moratoriums Lenders feel that more than an extension of the moratorium^ a one time restructuring of the loan for a longer tenure^ a facility which is currently available for the MSMEs and others^ would be more viable.“Transporters will be unable to make the re-payment to financiers if the moratorium is not extended^ with repossession starting from January 2021. If the moratorium is extended till September 2020^ around 15% vehicles will be repossessed from April 2021^” said Chetak.Amit Chandawar^ another large fleet operator based in Jaipur^ admits that only 10-15 per cent of his 2000 odd fleet capacity is currently being utilised.Financiers do foresee a lot of fleet operators voluntarily surrendering their vehicles. Industry estimates about 50^000 repossessed trucks by financiers and NBFCs after customers defaulted that are not finding any buyers and are lying in the yards.
12 May^ 2020,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/consumer-staples-technology-and-pharma-best-defensive-plays-in-town-jinesh-gopani/articleshow/75694811.cms,Economic Times,Consumer staples^ technology and pharma best defensive plays: Jinesh Gopani,It is better to be slightly underweight in financials and wait for clarity on economic revival^ says Head of Equity It is an unprecedented crisis and nobody knew this was coming. Last 50 days have been very difficult for the economy. So^ unless and until we get signs of the economy opening up and stimulus packages from the government to support certain sectors^ it would be difficult to estimate how much will be the knock on the economy. We have already taken a $270-280 billion knock in the GDP and we are still trying to open the economy after 50 days of lockdown.As you said^ in a way^ we have been able to manage the casualty rates much better as compared to the rest of the world. So clearly^ investors are waiting for economic relaxation to happen to understand how the consumer behaviour has changed^ how the economic activity is crawling back to normalcy along with the stimulus package.Someone has to take the brunt of this $280-billion GDP hit as of now because the stimulus package has not come. There is sort of a confusion and negativity about some of the sectors^ fearing they may not get any package or they may take time to come out of it. So^ clearly the longer lockdown would lead to more economic impact and it will take more time for the economy to revive.Some of the Asian economies like China^ Taiwan^ South Korea^ which have come out of the lockdown^ are returning to normalcy. Hopefully^ if there is no second wave^ money will move that side rather than coming to India. Also we have a situation of how much stimulus package to give whether we will go for a downgrade in terms of rating as also what will be the impact to the currency.There are too many question marks as of now. I am not saying the stimulus package is the only way to revive the economy^ but that is sort of a catalyst to start work. Lockdown relaxations have started to some degree but people will get a clear picture only after one or two months in terms of the revival of the economy. It is yet to be seen whether it is a 9-12 months or a six months journey. Till that happens^ we will be under a volatile phase of the market .We can argue on what defines quality but clearly^ in last 11 years^ what we have done has helped us out. So companies with strong management and balance sheets will survive for the next six months. There is a right to win for them for the next two to three years. Obviously^ companies will have to change some of their business models and adapt technologies very fast. If they are not adopting^ they will have to find out ways and means to prosper again. It depends on how strong is the management^ what is the capability of their balance sheets and that is where we are putting our money.Our theme has been to be with managements who understand these cycles well and who are able to navigate this phase well. Those who are able to survive for the next six months^ given strong balance sheets and the business model^ could be winners for the next two to three years. Obviously^ some of the leverage plays including financials will take time to come out of this. I do not know how the economy will revive but at least I can say that some of the other plays will be in a position to do better as compared to their peers.So the game is to identify the business models and stronger managements which have the ability to come out of this crisis in a much better position.Financials will take a beating for sometime because they are the backbone to the economy and the economy has come to halt. For the $270-280 billion GDP hit someone will have to pay the price and hence asset quality issues will come up in some of the banks.Nobody is going to be saved in this^ some will be less hit as compared to others. Some of the managements which understand the liquidity position and capital adequacy well and are able to raise capital at will will be able to manage the asset quality better. They could come out of this crisis in six to nine months time. Being a leveraged play^ obviously we need to be careful because you do not know how the hits will come^ how the asset quality will behave for us in a shorter period of time.Financial as a sector has been darling for the market for the last 10 years. Now with this Covid situation and economy coming to a grinding halt^ it will have to face asset quality issues and in that also you will have some winners. But I would say that as of now it is better to be slightly underweight in the sector and evaluate as and when there is clarity on economic revival.Everything is relative. Unless and until the medicine or the vaccine comes out^ clearly some of the so-called defensive as well as strong balance sheet sectors will do well -- be it consumer staples or technology or healthcare.Pharma as a sector has not done well for the last six^ seven years. With the Covid-18 pandemic^ healthcare as a piece is getting importance and there are some of the good companies which have already been doing well in the last many years and which will get further uptick in terms of improving their businesses.Everything is relative. These companies might also face some revenue slowdown or lesser revenue growth but at least it is the best sector as of now along with consumer staples and technology.This health crisis has changed the way the consumers will behave once the economy opens up and in that we are seeing that safety and security has become very important. If someone was travelling by public transport or someone was using the cab aggregators^ clearly they would start thinking of buying at least one vehicle -- be it a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler to ensure the safety of the family.Clearly the new normal will set in. The demand would not be the same for all segments but clearly car sales have just gone off the roof. Critical for India would be to see how the used car market behaves once the economy opens up. If that is going to sell like a hot cake^ then clearly the demand for the new two-wheelers or four-wheelers will be very strong.There could be pent up buying^ there could be revenge shopping that some people are talking about. All this will play out. We also should not forget that this will all depend on how the job losses scenario emerges or how people are able to get back to work and all sorts of things. But suffice to say that what we see in the other parts of the world^ something similar can happen even in India^ maybe not to that scale but at least much better than what we are now.The problem in India is that if you take some of the parameters of corporate governance^ strong business models and scalable business models^ then there are very few companies to play in India^ where you want to park your money.Clearly^ one of the names which you alluded to had a big share sell and you would have seen the demand it had both from the global as well as domestic investors. So it is a relative game. As of now^ the idea is to create a 35-stock^ 40-stock portfolio which will survive this difficult phase of this economy well.As and when the economy starts reviving obviously some shifts will happen to some of the other names which are battered down and are seeing revival in their business models. We need to understand that the new normal will be different^ we do not know how different it could be^ if a medicine or a vaccine comes up very^ very fast then things will change significantly. But if this continues and medicine and vaccine take much longer to come^ then clearly things will be looking weaker and hence some of these defensive plays will continue to rule the market for a longer time.I would say wait for two^ three months you will get a better clarity on the economy^ how it is opening up^ whether there is a second wave^ third wave of infection across the world or not. Even in India we have to be careful once we open up the economy and see how the infection rates flatten out.There are too many variables at play^ nobody knows how things will pan out^ nobody has seen this type of crisis and hence it is better to play safe^ play cautious rather than going all out in one go.

Indian FMCG industry growth rate has been on a downward trajectory for the last three quarters.“We don’t expect things to come to a standstill and consumption will go on after Covid-19 lockdown^” Prasun Basu^ South Asia Zone president of Nielsen Global Connect^ told newspersons in a virtual press conference on Thursday.“There will be sky-rocketing sales of certain categories^ while consumers will trade off few other categories. We had earlier estimated some recovery from the second quarter of the year and it’s going to be a good year. But there will certainly be a Covid-19 effect^” he said.As per Nielsen^ the overall FMCG market grew by 8% in February as compared to 5% in January and December^ and 6% in November. Hygiene categories reported significant growth in February^ such as hand sanitiser growing by 53% as compared to 11% growth in the previous three months. Even floor and toilet cleaners grew at a faster pace.In packaged food^ the growth rate in February accelerated to 10% as compared to 7% in January and December^ and 8% in November. In non-food segments^ there was 5% growth in February and compared to 1% in January and 3% each in preceding two months. Nielson said there was some impact of one extra day of consumption in February since this has been a leap year.Nielsen said consumers undertook precautionary buying across channels in last one month whereby sales growth of branded pulses went up from 16% to 72% and packaged atta from 20% to 25% in traditional stores between mid-Feb to mid-March. Sales growth of hand sanitiser doubled in these stores to 144%^ liquid hand wash went up to 42% from 28%^ antiseptic liquid from 6% to 39%^ and even widely penetrated toilet soap went up by one percentage point.In e-commerce^ average orders too surged for staples with edible oil growing by 106%^ salty snacks by 84%^ soft drink by 68% and biscuit by 31% on a weekly basis in last one month till last week.
